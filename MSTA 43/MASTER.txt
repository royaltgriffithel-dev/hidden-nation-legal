Social Duties2 
 
Holy Instructions from The Founder Noble Drew Ali 
 
1. “When thou considereth thy wants, when thou beholdeth thy imperfections, 
acknowledge his goodness, O son of humanity, who honored thee with humanity, 
endowed thee with speech, and placed thee in society to receive and conger 
reciprocal helps and mutual obligations, protections from injuries, thy 
enjoyments of the comforts and pleasures of life; all these thou oweth to the 
assistance of others, and couldst, not enjoy but in the bans of society. 
2. It is thy duty, therefore, to be a friend to mankind, as it is thy interest that man 
should be friendly to thee. 
3. as the rose breatheth sweetness from its own nature so the heart of a benevolent 
man produceth good works. 
4. He enjoyeth the ease and tranquility of his own breast, and rejoiceth in the 
happiness and prosperity of his neighbor. 
5. He openeth not his ear unto slander; the faults and the failing of men give a pain 
to his heart. 
6. His desire is to do good, and he researceth out the occasions thereof; in removing 
the oppression of another, he relieveth himself. 
7. From the largeness of his mind, he comprehendeth in his wishes the happiness 
of all men; and from the generosity of his heart, he endeavoreth to promote it.”

The Social System 
BY: Honorable Marcus M. Garvey 
Society is an organization of mankind to safeguard and protect its own interest. 
When society is organized and is made evident by regulations, rules and laws, every 
member of that society must obey the said rules, regulations, and laws. Therefore, 
always live up to the organized system of society of which you form a part. The only 
alternative to this is rebellion. You should never join rebellious movements against 
society, except when there is good reason and justification for it. Society is intended 
to maintain the greatest good for the greatest number, and that is always uppermost 
so that in thought you may have to reform.  
Any society must be calculated to bring about the greatest good for the greatest 
number and you must obey its laws, otherwise you are an evil genius living among that 
society and that society will seek to destroy you or compel you to obey its rules, 
regulations, and laws. You cannot live by yourself in a society. You must live upon the 
good will of your fellows. Therefore, in that society you must respect everything that 
tends to the good of all. You should always seek to have something at stake in the 
community in which you live; property of some kind, to merit the regard and respect 
of the community. Society as it is organized into a community, counts first its 
worthwhile citizens before it thinks of others. Property in a community is evidence of 
your status in the society of the community.  
If you have no property, have something of substantial value. The police, the 
officials and the government recognize property holders as the citizens of first claim 
in an organized society. They are generally recorded to be identified. Therefore, you 
must teach the people to own property and to be known and recognized members of 
the community. Always adopt a friendly attitude towards the police in your community 
PAGE 2 
because the police are that civil body of officials who are supposed to protect the 
citizens and see that their rights are not infringed upon. You should always welcome 
the police. The police are never the public enemy, but the public protector. You should 
help the police to maintain order because if the community loses its peace, you will 
have riots and probably bloodshed. No peaceful citizen wants to be caught in such a 
dangerous state of public affairs. Never join in to incite public disorder. Keep away 
from it and be innocent to all that happens, by way of revolution. Never allow  your 
(DIVINE CREED’S) or your name to be mentioned as among RIOTERS, you will destroy 
the usefulness of the organization and yourself in that community and may cause 
suspicion to be cast upon it in other communities.  
Always disavow any attempt to label your divine creed, or yourself with riotous 
behavior. Whatever object is desired in a civilized community it can always be achieved 
by the approach of good reason and good judgment. Always use good reason and good 
judgment. You are not in a community to overthrow the law in that community. You are 
there to live under the law. The national aspiration of the race is to find expression, 
not in revolution where you are established when you are under other people’s 
government, but to accomplish the end in America. Therefore, never preach rebellion, 
because you will disrupt the society in which you live, and it will crush you.  
The highest service a citizen can refer to in a community or organized society is 
to maintain and preserve peace. When the peace is disturbed, it is likely that anybody 
may get hurt and sometimes most innocently. Never join the mob. You will most likely 
be shot or injured even though you may only be curious. If you are shot or injured in a 
riotous demonstration it is almost[always] evidence against you that you were one of 
the rioters. So, keep away. When the riot act or martial law is read or proclaimed in 
your community, keep indoors. Give this advice to the people. Never join a mob in a 
PAGE 3 
foreign country under a foreign government, or where you have very little political 
influence. 
CHAPTER 1 History: News Paper “Chicago Defender 1928” 
National Governments First National Convention Oct. 15-20th 1928 
Historical Article: “The Chicago Defender: July 14, 1928; “Moorish Leader Makes 
Plans for Conclave. Beginning Oct. 15 and continuing through the entire week the 
Moorish Science Temple America, of which Noble Drew Ali is founder and president, will 
hold its first general conference at Unity Hall, 3140 Indiana Ave Chicago Ill. President 
Ali began definite plans to this end upon his recent return from Pine Bluff, Ark., where 
he spent some days lecturing at the local Moorish Temple. This organization is playing 
a useful and definite part in advancing the sacred obligations of American citizenship. 
Indications are that this convention will be one of the most interesting ever held in this 
city. There will be delegates from 15 different states where local temples 
(municipalities)  have been established.  
There will be an interesting event in which men and women members will were 
regalia similar to that worn in eastern countries. A camel will be presented during the 
session, specific reports of the general work and civil accomplishment of local temples. 
Report of the business enterprises that have been established in connection with these 
temples, such as grocery and market stores in Detroit, a laundry in Pittsburgh, Pa. 
These examples of collective effort show that the member of the Moorish Temple and 
their leader have a sound economic program and are blazing a trail and making the 
pathway over which our prosperity may travel unhampered and unafraid. ‘It must be 
kept in mind that no great movement can take definite shape in two years so as to be 
err proof,’ said President Ali. ‘However, through accumulation experience each annual 
convention ought to witness a more perfect and wider functioning organization, 
PAGE 4 
representing the organized experience of men and women member throughout the 
country and possibly in time the world over’.  
And continuing, President Ali said ‘‘Constructive criticisms from sympathetic 
friends in and outside of our organization are welcome’ A Moorish parade and the 
announcement of the Moorish governing council also held interest. About this the 
article states: “It is reported that the prophet, the Supreme Executive Authority, will 
appoint a supreme grand council, of which he will be the grand chairman. The Supreme 
Council will have power and control and supervise all the affairs and properties of the 
Moorish Science Temple of America, and it will become sole judge of what constitutes 
conduct injurious to the order, peace and interest or welfare with its constitution and 
by-laws, also the rules and regulations made by the prophet, and shall be the sole judge 
of the sufficiency of the evidence by which such conduct is shown. Prophet Noble Drew 
Ali is being congratulated by Chicagoans of the success of the Moors’ first annual 
convention and for his splendid work in promoting the cause of human brotherhood 
The name Moorish Temple of Science was changed to The Moorish Science Temple of 
America.” 
 
STATE DOCUMENTS, QUOTES: 1ST CONVENTIONS MINUTE ORDERS: “In an article 
after the convention, we read that on the opening day that the two Grand Governors; T. 
Crumby Bey of Pittsburg and Lomax Bey of Detroit read reports, Alderman Louis B. 
Anderson gave an opening address and others such as Oscar DePriest (Congressman 
and member3), Attorney’s Aaron Payne (member), Richard Ross Bey (Sheik and 
member), States Attorney George W. Blackwell, and Claude D. Green (managing editor 
of the Moorish Guide and chairman of the convention arrangements committee) spoke. 
 
3 Oscar DE Priest (Bey)  Congressman was the first Asiatic (African American) voted back in Congress in 110 years in 1928 through the great work of our Founder Drew Ali and the Moorish 
Science Temple of America.

THE PROPHETS WARNING TO THE NATION FRIDAY, November 30, 1928  
Quotes: “The citizens of all free National Governments, according to their National 
Constitution, are all of one family bearing one free National name. Those who fail to 
recognize the free National name of their Constitutional Government are classed as 
undesirable and are subject to all inferior names and abuses and mistreatments that 
the citizen cares to bestow upon them. And it is a sin for any group of people to violate 
the National Government; and cling to the names and principles that delude to slavery. 
I, the Prophet, was prepared by the Great God Allah, to warn my people to repent from 
their sinful ways, and go back to that state of mind to their forefathers’ Divine and 
National Principles- that they will be law abiders and receive their divine right(s) as 
citizen(s) according to the free national Constitution that was prepared for all free 
National beings-they are to claim their own free National name and religion4.  
There is but one issue for them to be recognized by this Government and of the earth, 
and that comes only through the connection of the Moorish Divine National Movement 
and recognized by all other nations of the world. And through it they and their children 
can receive their divine rights, unmolested by other citizens. That they can cast a free 
National ballot to the polls under the free National Constitution of the United States 
Government, and not a “Granted Privilege” as has been the existing condition for many 
generations… 
Money does not make a man; it is free national standers and power that make a man 
and nation. The wealth of all National governments, gold d sliver commerce, belongs to 
the citizen alone; and without your national citizenship by name and principle, you have 
no true wealth. And I am herby calling on all true citizens that stand for a National Free 
Government and the enforcement of the Constitution to help me in my great missionary

work, because I need all support from all true American citizens of the United States 
of American to help me to save my people, who have fallen from the Constitutional laws 
of this government. I am depending on your support to get them back to hem 
Constitutional fold again, that they will learn to love, instead of hate, and will live 
according to Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom, and Justice, supporting our free National 
Constitution of the United States of America. 
I love my people, and I desire their unity and mine back to their own free national and 
Divine Standard, because day by day they have been violating the National and 
Constitutional Laws of their government by calming names and principles that are 
unconstitutional. If Italians, Greek, English, Chinese, Turks, and Arabians are forced to 
proclaim their free national name and religion before the Constitutional Government 
of the United States of America, it is no more than right that the law should be forced 
upon all American citizens alike. 
Through your free National name, you are known and recognized by all nations of the 
earth that are recognized by the said national government in which they live. The 14th 
In all other governments, when a man is born and raise there and asked his name of 
national decent and name if he fails to give it, he is misused, imprisoned, or exiled. Any 
group of people who fail to answer up to the Constitutional Standards of Law by name 
and principle, because to be a citizen of any government you must claim your National 
name descent. Because they place their trust upon issue and names that they are not 
a part and partial of, and nether were they formed by their forefathers. The word 
‘Negro” deludes in Latin language to the word “nigger”; the same, the word “colored” 
deludes to anything that is painted, varnished, and dyed, and every nation must bear a 
national descent name of their forefathers, because honoring thy father and thy 
mothers, your days will be lengthened upon this earth. These names have never been 
recognized by any true American citizens of this day.   
PAGE 6 
and 15th amendments brought the North and South in unity; placing the Southerner, 
which was at that time without power, with the Constitutional Body of power. And at 
that time, 1865, the free national Conational Law that was enforced since 1774 declared 
by the Free National Constitution to be free and equal, since that Constitution has never 
been changed, there is no need for the application of the 14th and 15th Amendments for 
the Salvation of our people and citizens. 
So, there isn’t but one supreme issue for my people to use to redeem that which 
was lost, and that is through the above statements, then the lion and the lamb can lie 
down to gather in yonder hills and neither will be harmed; because Love, Truth, Peace, 
Freedom, and Justice will be reigning in this land. In those days the United Stated will 
be one of the greatest civilized and prosperous government of the world, but if the 
above principles are not carried out by the citizen and my people in this government, 
the worst is yet to come, because the Great God of the Universe is not pleased with the 
work that are being performed in North America by my people, and this great sin must 
be removed from the land to save it from enormous earthquakes, diseases, etc. 
This is a field held open men to strong men and women to uplift the nation and 
take your place in the affairs of men. If the European and other nations are helping me, 
The Voice of the Founder of the National Government 
If you have race pride and love your race, join the Moorish Science Temple of 
America, and become a part of this Divine Movement. Then you will have power to 
redeem your race because you will know who you are, and your forefathers were. 
Because where there is unity, there is strength. : “Together we stand, divided we fall.” 
Come, good people, because I, the Prophet, was sent to redeem this nation from mental 
slavery, which you have now, need every one of you who think(s) your condition can be 
better.  
PAGE 7 
why not you? It is your problem. The Negro and,(Latino) problem is being solved only 
as it can, and that is by the Moorish Divine Movement. If you have a nation, you must 
have a free national name in order to be recognized by this nation as an American 
citizen. This is what was meant when it was said “Seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven 
and all these things would be added unto you.” By the Prophet 
Thus, the United States of America became a true nation under God when the prophet 
wrapped the Moorish Flag around the little Moorish girl and the American Flag around 
Another important historical distinction needs to be made: The help the 
Prophet gave to the United States was legitimacy. Before the Prophet Drew Ali’s great 
work, the United States was not considered to be a nation in the sense of international 
law and was ruled on by the Supreme Court in 1794 in the case of Chrisholm v. Georgia, 
2 Dall. (U.S.) 419, 1 L. Ed. 440 (1793). United States the country is a ‘society’ and 
‘sovereignty’ but not a “nation” under the laws of nations by the supreme court’s own 
admission. when it said: This is a case of uncommon magnitude. One of the parties to 
it is a State; certainly respectable, claiming to be sovereign. The question to be 
determined is, whether this State, so respectable, and whose claim soars so high, is 
amenable to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States? This question, 
important in itself, will depend on others, more important still; and may, perhaps, be 
ultimately resolved into one, no less radical than this 'do the people of the United States 
form a Nation?' A cause so conspicuous and interesting should be carefully and 
accurately viewed from every possible point of sight. I shall examine it, 1st. By the 
principles of general jurisprudence. 2nd. by the laws and practice of States and 
Kingdoms. From the law of nations little or no illustration of this subject can be 
expected. By that law the several States and Governments spread over our globe, are 
considered as forming a society, not a NATION. [Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. (U.S.) 419, 
1 L.Ed. 440 (1793)]

the little Moorish boy at the 1st National Convention of 1928. “…I made you a nation within 
a nation the wheel within the wheel…” Prophet Drew Ali. Thus, the Moorish Science

HIGH STANDARDS. 
— Civilization is not a circle but a pyramid. At its base is found the constantly 
increasing mass of humanity. Out of this common material the world has been busily 
engaged in building the structure of civilization. No one is compelled to remain at the 
base of the pyramid who has within himself the ability to find his way up. From that 
base have come most of the great men in history. Few born in riches or high social 
position have ever achieved greatness. By her system of Government America is at the 
mercy of those at the base of the pyramid. If through individual initiative and proper 
leadership they win their way toward the apex, they lift America also. If they remain 
inert, ignorant, indifferent, they become the common prey of unscrupulous leaders who 
seek to weaken or destroy the structure of our government. 
Without knowledge of self-government, denied the opportunity for self-development, 
eagerly responding to the call of American opportunity, emigrated to our shores, here 
CITIZENSHIP TRAINING. 
— Training in citizenship is the most vital of all subjects to that nation whose system 
of government, security of property, and full power to express individual initiative are 
based upon the intelligence, education, and character of each individual citizen. 
PAGE 9 
PAGE 10 
to enjoy full participation in the rights of American citizenship without a proper 
Understanding of the meaning of liberty or the nature and value of our free institutions, 
the very foundation of which is laid in intelligent and active participation in government 
by our individual citizens. A course of instruction in citizenship to be effective must 
develop the social phase of citizenship and be particularly directed to the native and 
foreign-born youth, setting up a clear understanding of this great problem of 
assimilation and amalgamation of the bloods of all nations into the virile life stream of 
America. 
GENERAL PURPOSE. — This course in citizenship is designed to teach the fundamental 
principles upon which our Government is founded, including an insight into the social 
and economic elements upon which our civilization stands. Special emphasis is laid 
upon the meaning of "Religious liberty," as interpreted by the founders of this Republic, 
and the larger relationship of the individual citizen to others and to his Government, 
defining loyalty and national responsibility in terms of citizenship, recognizing that an 
intelligent and informed people is a greater asset than are the unintelligent, 
uninformed, or misinformed, and that no government can exist upon a plane higher 
than the moral character of its people.  
Knowledge, the safeguard of our Republic. — Because of the rapid increase in 
our population, largely made up of immigrants from all parts of the world, the tendency 
within the family and the school is to neglect the training of our youth in the knowledge 
of his government and his individual responsibility. It cannot be expected that foreign
born parents, lacking knowledge or inspiration of American ideals, will be either fitted 
or inspired to give such instruction to their own children. 
The indifference or the neglect of native-born citizens concerning the training of 
their children to meet the responsibilities of citizenship is largely caused by lack of 
PAGE 11 
information and proper tinder standing of the history, ideals, and underlying principles 
of our political institutions. 
The solution of the problems of citizenship lies largely in the education of the 
youth of America in the principles of representative government and their personal 
responsibility in perpetuating and improving her free institutions.  
CHARACTER BUILDING. — The ever-increasing wants as compared to the needs of 
humanity, the added individual burdens, and problems of modern civilization, 
emphasizing material rather than ethical and spiritual attainment, are tending to break 
down the character of our youth. 
It is the mission of this course to especially emphasize the moral aspects of citizenship 
— to build up home discipline, reverence for religion, and respect for constituted 
authority.  
 NATIONAL DEFENSE. — Education and training in citizenship form a vital part of national 
defense. It will be the mission of this course to interpret national defense through a 
broad and comprehensive instruction in citizenship, stressing the responsibility of the 
individual citizen to become fully prepared for the defense of his country in any 
emergency that may arise, whether of domestic or foreign import, in peace or in war. 
Under the immigration act the following classes of persons are excluded from entering 
the United States: 
a. Idiots. 
b. Insane. 
c. Epileptics. 
d. Paupers and persons likely to become a public charge. 
e. Professional beggars. 
PAGE 12 
f. Rapist & Pedophiles  
Persons suffering from tuberculosis or other dangerous or loathsome contagious 
diseases. Persons physically or mentally so defective as to be unable to making a 
living. But not limited to.  
 
Right of suffrage. — Under the Constitution, the National Government confers 
American citizenship, but it is left to the States to determine who may vote at both its 
own and national elections.  
Under the Constitution, voting is the only means provided for the expression of public 
opinion — it is the exercise of the will of the citizen in the protection of his rights. 
 OBLIGATIONS OF NATIONAL CITIZENSHIP. — Active national citizenship is gained only by 
becoming an enfranchised citizen of the National Government. This carries with it the 
obligation of a clear understanding of the principles of government and the courage to 
demand that these principles be not abridged. 
It is essential that the individual citizen — Exercise his right of franchise — vote — as 
his paramount duty at all elections. Uphold the Constitution as the one assurance of 
the security and perpetuation of the free institutions of America. Practice self
government to assure good government for all.  
Respect the rights of others, to assure the enjoyment of his own. Contribute to 
the maintenance of his government by the payment of taxes. Obeying the law as the 
first essential to law enforcement. Place service to country above service to self. 
Conform his conduct to the best interests of society.  
The opportunities and privileges of the American citizen are limited only by his 
individual ability, his personal habits, and conformity to necessary legal regulations. It 
PAGE 13 
is your obligation to exercise — Care in your choice of occupation. Diligence in 
preparation for your task. Thrift to insure advancement and prosperity. Judgment in 
selection of companions. Integrity, honor, initiative, self-reliance, self-control. 
Be, Beneficial to production. — Industry is essentially the subjection of natural 
forces — the manipulation of natural material to the uses of mankind; it brings into 
action the worker, the engineer, the inventor, the organizer, the administrator, the 
combined energies of whom are liberated and set in motion by finance.  
Accumulation of capital. — Thrift is the foundation stone of effective economic 
interdependence. The individual must practice frugality, engage in hard work, and 
acquire the habit of wise spending — so living within his means as to enable a saving 
of a portion of the product of his labor. In industry wealth is the product of saving; it is 
secured in part by the elimination of waste and the corresponding conservation of 
materials and labor practiced by both individuals and groups, and saving or the 
accumulation of capital is as much the duty of the employee as of the employer.  
Relations between management and men. — To derive the greatest value from 
the interdependent relationship between employer and employee there must be 
created a spirit of good will and cooperation in which there is a recognition of mutual 
worth and mutual responsibility. The atmosphere surrounding the relationship between 
management and men must eliminate fear, apprehension, and uncertainty. 
 Only by the establishment of mutual understanding, confidence, and respect can 
effective cooperation and teamwork be secured. That employee renders best service 
who has an intelligent understanding of the relation of his part to the whole. 
WE ARE A NATION OF SPECIALISTS. — We are a Nation of specialists because 
experience has taught us that greater benefits will accrue to one and all through each 
individual learning to do one thing well. The physician looks after our health. The 
PAGE 14 
teacher gives instruction. The farmer grows the grain. The lawyer attends to legal 
matters. Others specialize in providing all the comforts and conveniences of home. No 
one citizen builds his own house, manufactures the plumbing equipment, generates the 
electricity, constructs the heating plant, or provides the fuel for its operation. He does 
not pave the street, put in his own waterworks, provide police, and fire protection, 
establish his own school, church, hospital, or theater. 
Be Beneficial to peace. — In America a degree of independence is developed 
out of which is born the idea in the minds of many that a citizen of the United States 
may be a law unto himself, retaining, however, the disposition to regulate the other 
fellow. If he does not like the law he seeks a way to evade it, at the same time shouting 
vociferously over the increase of crime and the lessened influence of our courts.  
He demands the highest wages obtainable and complains at the prices he must 
pay for the product of his fellow laborer. He insists upon his right to independence and 
liberty, yet is ever ready to restrict such action on the part of others. That citizen who 
has not developed the spirit of cooperation, understanding and tolerance is at war with 
his fellow man. 
Unselfishness. — Every American citizen must guard against the spirit of 
selfishness, the inordinate desire for material gain, the temptation to live beyond his 
means, and the tendency to find the easiest way to obtain the most in satisfying his 
constantly increasing wants. 
Honesty — individual and collective, national, and international — inspiring 
confidence wherein there is neither room for trickery nor unfair practices is the basis 
of the principle of interdependent relationships. Such honesty rests not so much upon 
legal rights as upon the Golden Rule. 
Class consciousness. — Class consciousness and class activity is the result 
largely of the intrusion of ideas of government entirely outside of the fixed principles 
set forth in our Constitution and should be no more tolerated in our country than we 
would expect our principles, if introduced by expatriated Americans, to be accepted by 
another nation. Classism is the foundations of racism and is not tolerated in our 
civilized society. 
Immigrant is not the problem. — The immigrant is not the problem. He has 
been one of the outstanding assets in the development of America. Slowly, but surely, 
there is being assimilated and amalgamated in this country the bloods of practically all 
nations, in the development of a racial stock of exceptional worth in 'its vigor, ability, 
and character. Our opportunity. — One of our greatest problems is the education, 
assimilation, and amalgamation of these various and numerous foreign groups into an 
understanding, harmonious, loyal, and upstanding American citizenship.  
Why is Nationality the order of the day? Has anyone ever answered or asked that 
question to their government official or better yet yourself? Good. The Holy Prophet 
To this and succeeding generations is given the opportunity to develop from our 
homogeneous character an outstanding race expressive of the highest principles, 
ideals, and traditions to which a God-loving, humanity-loving, liberty-loving people can 
aspire. 
To accomplish this great work there must be a composition of all differences 
which tend to create class consciousness and class hatreds. Tolerance, born of 
knowledge, understanding, respect, sympathy, and harmony, engendered by the spirit 
of a common cause and purpose.

PAGE 16 
Noble Drew Ali and his divine Ministers of his cabinet gave out calling cards to the 
Asiatic of North America, which told us to… “Come all ye Asiatic and learn the Truth 
about your Nationality and Birthrights, because you are not colored, etc. (Black, Latino). 
And you must claim a free national name to be an American citizen…” Did you get your 
divine calling? 
CIVIC’S OF NATIONALITY [BLK’sLaw6th] Nationality: “that quality or character which 
arise from the fact of a person belonging to a nation or state. Nationality determines 
the political status especially with reference to allegiance, while domicile determines 
his civil status. Nationality arises ether by birth or naturalization.” Nationality affords 
the state jurisdiction over the person and affords the person the protection of the 
state.  
The two most important parts of this definition to understand from a scientific 
eye is domicile and thee most important from these two are political status. Some facts 
about Nationality: 1.1 is a political status, 1.2 is defined by the Constitution, which is a 
political document. 1.3 Is synonymous with being a ‘national’ within statutory law. 1.4. 
Gives one the right to political association. 1.5 Gives one constitutional citizenship. 1.6 
Is associated with a specific country. 1.7 Is called a ‘political citizen’ or a citizen of the 
United States in a political sense, by the courts to distinguish it from a STATUTORY 
citizen. See Powel v United States, 109 F.2d 147 (1940), Nationality therefore is the 
principal relationship that connects an individual to a state. Let us Look at Political 
Status and begin to connect the dots. 
[BLK 6th p.1158] Political: pertaining or relating to the policy or the administration 
of government, state or national. Pertaining to or incidental to, the exercise of the 
functions vested in those charged with the conduct of government; of or pertaining to 
exercise of rights and privileges or the influence by which individuals of a state seek 
to determine or control its public policy; having to do with organization or action of 
PAGE 17 
individual parties. Political status gives one Political Rights. Political Rights are those, 
which may be exercised in the formation or administration of the government. Rights 
of a citizen established or recognized by constitution (Divine Constitution & By-Laws) 
which gives them the power to participate directly or indirectly in the establishment 
or administration of government.  
Nationality gives one Political Right’s within those political rights is the right of 
association to associate with your political community: the right to freedom of 
association and freedom from compelled association, (first Amendment to the 
Constitution). Association is the freedom to choose; choose a domicile,(“…let the bonds 
of affection, therefore unite thee with thy brothers, that peace and happiness may 
dwell in thy father’s house and when ye separate in the world, remember the relation 
that bindeth you to love and unity; and prefer not a stranger before thy own blood.” 
HKofMSTofA XXV: 2-3) it is voluntarily entered.  
 
Please at this stage pay very close attention….When you choose your 
associations (political community) which is determined by your ‘Domicile’ you have 
chosen your Civil Status or Legal status. At this stage if one has proclaimed his 
nationality with the lawful government aka The Moorish Science Temple of America; 
Home Office of Noble Drew Ali, 805 7th St. Eureka Ca 95501., and its lawful branch 
temples (Act 1. Additional Laws) and “…proclaimed their (your) free national name in 
the government in which you live and the nations of the earth…” you are a ‘National’… 
(We the People) well that is yet to be determined. Let us define a few more terms before 
we move on. Domicile: a person’s legal home. That place where a man has his true 
fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment, and to which whenever he is 
absent has the intention of returning. Smith v. Smith 206 Pa.Super.310, 213 A.2d 94. 
Generally. Physical presence within a state and the intention to make it one’s home are 
PAGE 18 
the requirements of establishing a ‘domicile’ therein. A person may have more than 
one residence but only one domicile.  
The legal domicile of a person is important since it rather than the actual resident 
often controls the jurisdiction of the taxing and policing authorities(i.e., tickets, 
infraction of the law) and determines where a person may exercise the 
privileges/rights of voting and other legal rights and immunities. (Speaking on taxes 
for all you who are reluctant about taxes ...Being domicile and not nationality is what 
imputes a status under the tax code and a liability for tax.) 
TAX LIABILITY 
Tax liability is civil liability that attaches to civil statutory law, which attaches to 
a ‘person’ through their choice of domicile. {Your Per-Capita Tax to your domicile is 
very important. To be able to prove you pay taxes to your lawful Civil government were 
your domiciled at,} (Ask yourself -can they tax a Religious Body Politic. What about an 
agent [missionary or citizen] from that Body politic? [See 1099 form; ‘Our Authority’]) 
No one can force you to acquire or retain a domicile anywhere, including within the 
federal government or to accept the civil status that attaches to it of statutory citizen 
(14th Amendment citizen) or resident. It is voluntary. Domicile determines your Civil 
and Legal and Statutory status. It does not determine your political status or 
Nationality. Civil Status or Legal status: (Civil: originally pertaining to or appropriate 
to a member of a civitas or free political community; natural or proper to a citizen 
{National}.  
The taxing clause. — The taxing clause permits taxes to be levied for the 
requirements of government only; such taxes to be uniform in application and subject 
to revision as necessity governs. 
PAGE 19 
The Congress shall have power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts' and 
Excises, to pay the debts and provide for the Common Defense and Welfare of the 
United States. * * * To declare War, grant letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make 
rules concerning captures on Land and Water; to raise and support Armies, but no 
appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years. * * * To 
provide and maintain a Navy; To make rules for the Government and Regulation of the 
land and naval forces; To provide for calling forth the Militia; to execute the laws of the 
Union, to suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; To provide for organizing, arming 
and disciplining the Militia. * * * — Constitution, Article I, section 8. 
NATIONALITY AND CIVIL STATUS-CONTINUED  
Also, relating to the community, or to the policy and government of the citizen 
and subject of a state.) Civil Status: gives you 1. The ability to contract with other 
parties including the government. 2. Politically and legally associate with groups you 
choose to associate with. *3. Choose or nominate the civil government that you want 
to protect your rights to life liberty and property...this is where your jury of peers is 
established, etc.3.1 choosing a domicile is an act of political association that has legal 
consequences in which you nominate a specific municipal government to protect your 
rights and property.[In others word the local governmental laws that will govern you]  
This is why the Declaration of Independence says that all just powers of 
government are derived from the consent of the people. Those who do not concede to 
a civil municipality have no civil protection or real Civil Rights you would be 
automatically presumed to have a statutory citizenship status [14th Amendment citizen 
see Civiliter Mortuus or Civil Death]. Domicile is how you exercise rights 2 and 3. You 
can choose where your domicile is, and you can change it at any time. When you choose 
PAGE 20 
a domicile, you elect or nominate a protector, which in turn gives rise to an obligation 
to pay for the civil protection demanded (Taxes). 
 The method of providing that protection is the civil laws of the municipal (as in 
Branch Temple) jurisdiction that you chose a domicile within; ( Divine Constitution and 
By-Laws, Additional Laws, the Koran, General Laws, Supreme Laws, Rules, and 
Regulations, of the Prophet are the civil laws of the religious government (National 
Government) Now what does it all mean? Well, when one proclaims a Nationality their 
Political Status {political rights} is established (‘National’ of the United States of 
America, Moorish American) giving you the choice to associate with a political 
community(Grand Temple, Grand Major Temples, Branch Temples) to establish your 
Civil Status/Legal Status your laws that will govern you. By your choice of 
Domicile ;( Home Office of Noble Drew Ali) thus creating the political or constitutional 
and civil status of a human being. A National a true American citizen of the United 
States of America the Republic. A Moorish American! We The People,  
Let us go a little further. nationality affords you your citizenship as a national, a 
constitutional citizen. citizens are members of a political community who in their 
associated capacity, have established or submitted themselves to the dominion of a 
government. {the religious Body Politic aka Moorish Science Temple of 
America/National Government.} By giving up some of their natural rights for the 
promotion of their general welfare and the protection of their individual as well as 
collective rights. Herriot v City of Seattle 81 Wash. 2d 48 500 P 2nd 101, 109.  
Citizen one who under the Constitution and laws of the United States of America 
or of a particular state, is a member of the political community owing allegiance 
(allegiance is associated with Nationality allegiance is what makes one a 
citizen/subject of a country.) And being entitled to the enjoyments of full Civil Rights. 
PAGE 21 
One’s full Civil Rights are enforced through municipal civil law, which in turn can only 
attach to one’s choice of legal domicile. 
CHAPTER III NATIONAL CITIZENSHIP AND/OR NATIONAL OF THE U.S.A. 
  Defined under federal law pursuant to 8U.S.C Sec. 1101(a)(12), under laws of Nation, 
under state Laws and under U.S.A. Constitution. (I). Is equivalent to the term “state 
citizen” (II). In general, born in any one of the several states of the union but not in a 
federal territory, possession, or the Districts of Columbia, and not domiciled in the 
federal zone.( III). Owes allegiance to ‘We the People’, collective, and individually within 
the body politic of the constitutional state residing in. (Moorish Science Temple of 
America)  May serve as a state jurist or grand jurist involving only parties with his/her 
same citizenship and domicile status. ( Jury of your peers).  
May vote in state elections (electors)  Is a man or woman whose unalienable 
natural rights are recognized, secured, and protected by his state (Body Politic) 
National citizenship is a Constitutional citizen: Constitutional Citizen is a political status 
tied to: (I). Nationality (II). The U.S. Constitution (III). Political jurisdiction and a specific 
political status “Nation” under the laws of Nations.  
See National or state national or national of the United State of America or United 
States under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101 (a) (21) National can also be described as a “citizen” 
when he/she is domiciled within the territorial and legislative jurisdiction of the 
Political Body to which one claims allegiance, being a ‘National” is therefore an 
attribute and a prerequisite of being a citizen and the term can be used to describe 
‘citizen.” “Any group of people who fail to answer up to the Constitutional Standards of 
Law by name and principle, (Surname and Law) because to be a citizen of any 
government you must claim your national name and descent.”

family then forming part of his household. 
(7) “National of the United States” has the meaning prescribed in section 
101(a)(22) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(22)). (c) If the victim 
of an offense under subsection (a) is an internationally protected person outside the

victim is a representative, officer, employee, or agent of the United States, (2) an 
offender is a national of the United States, or (3) an offender is afterwards found in 
the United States. As used in this subsection, the United States includes all areas under 
the jurisdiction of the United States including any of the places within the provisions of 
PAGE 23 
sections 5 and 7 of this title and section 46501(2) of title 49. (d) In the course of 
enforcement of this section and any other sections prohibiting a conspiracy or attempt 
to violate this section, the Attorney General may request assistance from any Federal, 
State, or local agency, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, any statute, rule, or 
regulation to the contrary notwithstanding. Section 101(a)(22) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act (INA) states that “the term ‘national of the United States’ means (A) a 
citizen of the United States, or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United 
States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States.” Therefore, U.S. citizens are 
also U.S. nationals. 
CHAPTER IV NATIONAL GOVERNMENT’S RELIGIOUS STRUCTURE 
The entire structure of the National Republic of the United States of America 
Religious structure and its citizens, its laws, customs, duties, Rules, Regulations, are 
all under a Religious Body Politic a Nation. (Only comparison would be the Vatican 
Religious Governmental organization)  RE: Our Authority “Corporation-Religious 
Affidavit of Organization”. Religious Corporation Act Ch. 32 par.164 Sec.35 “Any church, 
congregation or society formed for the purpose of religious worship may become 
incorporated in the following… and may adopt a corporate, by name… it shall and 
remain a body politic and corporate, by the name so adopted. What do other laws say 
about Religion? RFRA (Religious freedom and restoration Act)  
Respect for religion. — The "National Government" believes in the exercise of 
religious freedom and shows tolerance toward and respect for all religious beliefs. 
The American Government rests upon the deep religious convictions of her 
people. If it is to continue it will be through unceasing respect for and confidence in 
the nobler things of life. 
PAGE 24 
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. — No greater liberty was ever conferred on a people than that 
of freedom to worship according to the dictates of one's own conscience. The first 
amendment to the Constitution declares that "Congress shall make no law respecting 
an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof." 
All persons have the privilege to entertain any religious belief, practice any 
religious rite, teach any religious doctrine, which is not subversive of morality and 
does not interfere with the personal rights of others. However, this liberty cannot be 
"invoked as a protection against legislation for the punishment of acts inimical to the 
peace, good order, and morals of society," because professed doctrines of religious 
belief are not superior to the laws of the land. No person is permitted to become a law 
unto himself, nor may they in the name of religion, or through a religious ceremony, 
violate the law.  
Religious liberty does not include the right to introduce and carry out every 
scheme or purpose which people see fit to claim as a part of their religious system. 
While there is no legal authority to constrain belief, no one can lawfully stretch his own 
liberty of action so as to interfere with that of his neighbors or violate peace or good 
order. — United States Supreme Court. Laws are made for the government of actions, 
and while they cannot interfere with mere religious beliefs and opinions, they may with 
practices. — United States Supreme Court. 
Religion laid the foundations of our American Government. It neither seeks nor 
claims any justification for its existence save righteousness. It had its beginning. it 
found its inspiration, in the religious beliefs of the men who settled our country, made 
it an independent Nation, and maintained its institutions and laws. If it is to endure it 
will be through the support of men of like mind and like character. — President Coolidge. 
PAGE 25 
POLITICAL RIGHTS. — It protects the citizen in his personal freedom. Equal political rights 
are assured. He has a voice in the Government which is "of the people, for the people, 
and by the people." When a people are free to undertake things and take advantage of 
the opportunities open to them wealth, character, and national strength are developed. 
Political right are established by ones nationality.  Protection to home and family. — 
The social unit of civilization is the family. Under this form of government, the 
institution of marriage and the rights of childhood are respected, the home and the 
family are protected, and womanhood is inviolable.  
 The supreme Court had found “exercise” to be burdened when laws interfere with 
a particular religious practice or ceremony (Gonzales v O Centro espirita Beneficento 
Uniao do Vegetal, 564. U.S. 418 (2000) “Courts may not decide matters of church 
doctrine or governance.”(Cf. Kedroff v St. Nicholas Cathedral, 344 U.S. 94,116 (1952)) 
U.S. v Ballard (1944) The Courts found that neither neither the courts nor the 
government have the right to evaluate the religious beliefs of a citizen or group. 
*Waston v Jones, 80 U.S. (13 Wall) Courts may not interfere in matters of church 
doctrine, discipline, or policy. [T]he First Amendment rest upon the premise that both 
religion and government can best work to achieve their lofty aims if each is left free 
from the other within it-respected sphere. (Jurisdiction) Justice Hugo Black (Mc 
Collum v Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203, 212 (1984))  
According to the United States Supreme Acts of State to wit: “Every sovereign 
state is bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign State and the 
courts of another country will NOT SIT in Judgment on the acts of the government of 
another, done within its own territory.” Also, where rights are secured by the 
Constitution are involved, there can be no rulemaking or legislation which would 
abrogate them Miranda v Arizona 384 US 436,125: (10) PAGE 135 The claim and exercise

Moorish Science Temple of America deriving its power and authority for the Grate 
Koran of Mohammed to propagate the faith and extend the learning and the truth of the 
Great Prophet of Ali in America.” 
What do other laws say about Religion? RFRA (Religious freedom and restoration

a particular religious practice or ceremony (Gonzales v O Centro espirita Beneficento 
Uniao do Vegetal, 564. U.S. 418 (2000) “Courts may not decide matters of church

respect the independence of every other sovereign State (people) and the courts of 
another country will NOT SIT in Judgment on the acts of the government of another, 
done within its own territory.” Also, where rights are secured by the Constitution are

fact today!! And all this above come by way of your nationality, better yet you truly 
understanding Your Nationality. In conclusion I hope this academic brings Moor light to 
the importance of ‘KEEPING THE PROPHET OUT IN FRONT’ the jurisprudence thereof

themselves and

raisheth friends, and I will follow it.” Are not the enemies, made by truth better than 
friends obtained by flattery?”5 
 
CHAPTER V    Character  
The greatest asset of America. — Diversity of opinion as to what is America's greatest 
asset creates a discussion which leads into every section and every activity of our 
country. Everyone is governed by the interest that lies closest to his heart. 47. 
Character. — What unites a people composed of all the racial stocks of the world? What 
composes our differences, harmonizes our relationships? What inspires confidence, 
ensures credit, and promotes organization?  
What, in the last analysis, guarantees protection of person and property, gives 
assurance of peace and prosperity, and inspires America to greater adventures and 
larger achievements? The answer is not to be found in the sum of all her natural 
 
5 Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America Ch. XLIII: 18 
PAGE 28 
resources, factories, farms, homes, schools, hospitals, and churches. These are 
created by man and by man can be destroyed. The security of our property, the 
continuation of our institutions, the increase of our possessions and the perpetuity of 
the principles of individual rights, justice, and freedom, the observance of which has 
made America, lie in character — the greatest asset of America. 
Foundation of character. — The character of the individual and the Nation is 
founded upon religion and education — which, united with that force we call "will," give 
to every individual the means for high attainment. Submitting yourself to these 
impelling influences, resourcefulness and unconquerable energy take command. By 
their power you win self-mastery. The joy of work becomes a reality. Labor is dignified 
by the pride of accomplishment. Obstacles and handicaps are but a challenge to 
greater effort. Discipline becomes self-imposed. 
Daily performance necessary. — Expressed in terms of unselfish devotion to 
ideals, our attitude to others, our sense of responsibility, our willingness to give full 
service, loyal cooperation, our faithfulness to each other, and our reverence for 
religion, embodied in the daily performance of every task, "character" is the greatest 
asset of America. 
Spirit of improvement and invention. — Ever willing to adopt new ideas, to 
develop and improve, to tear down and rebuild, to scrap the machine of yesterday for 
the improved equipment of to-day, opportunity was never neglected to find a better 
way to do a larger business. 
Success possible to every citizen. — Driven first by necessity, the joy of 
accomplishment became the spur to greater achievements. The way to comfort, to 
competency, to wealth was open and free to every citizen, limited alone by individual 
ability, courage, and determination. Out of great opportunity, with freedom to all, there 
PAGE 29 
has been bred a race of men and women of sterling character and outstanding 
independence. 
Ethical character. — Confidence. — American business is based upon the 
character of its people. 
Spirit of cooperation and compromise. — One of the most encouraging signs 
of continued prosperity in America is the constantly growing tendency toward 
compromise and cooperation in the affairs of capital and labor, based upon mutual 
confidence. Such differences as are bound to arise are, as a rule, disposed of to the 
general good of all. 
No class domination. — No class is permitted to dominate in America. Public 
opinion, which is always representative of public character, will not permit the 
assumption of power. Whether it be capital, labor, farmer, group, or section, public 
character in its dominant sense of fair dealing defeats the effort to acquire unfair 
advantage. 
Spirit of benevolence. — Nothing is more characteristic of modern American 
life than the pouring out of private wealth for public service. 
Political character. — Diplomacy. — America is slowly ret surely winning the 
confidence of the nations of the world. The desire to arbitrate rather than resort to 
armaments has distinguished America in her international policy, desiring to adjust all 
differences within the principles of justice and equity. Her commercial treaties are 
written in terms of square dealing. Backed by the guaranty of the American character, 
her obligations and her dollars are eagerly accepted wherever they may be offered. 
Community life, religious meetings, and town meeting. —  
PAGE 30 
Possessing pride of race, proud of their ancestry, they inspired in the hearts of 
their children a reverence and respect for family and race which left no room for lax 
conduct or easy habits. Severely disciplined within their homes, carefully supervised 
in their education, the children were taught the obligation of participation in community 
affairs and were obliged to submit to the severe restrictions imposed by their elders 
through the laws enacted by the local town meeting. 
VOTING: A NATIONAL REQUIREMENT 
 Moorish Guide New Paper: Political Slavery Friday, February 19, 1929 
 “Anytime a Man or Woman fails or refuse to cast a sacred ballot at the polls they 
separate themselves from all rights of an American citizen. For surly this is the one 
connecting medium for a citizen to his nation. They become no more than belated beast 
of burdens. There are reasons why certain classes, who are more or less independent, 
take no part in politics since they say they get nothing out of such in the way of material 
gain. This is no less than a political slave since they refuse to voice their sentiments at 
the poll. Another form of political slavery which is probably more prevalent among the 
less independent classes is that of being forced into one of the major parties and there 
bribed, coerced, or otherwise forced to vote the wishes of someone else regardless 
of their own minds. Before there can be general relief for the economic good of all, all 
forms of political slavery must be abolished, and every citizen must take his part in the 
affairs of the nation.”  
 
CHAPTER VI LIBERTY AND INDEPENDENCE 
 
PAGE 31 
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, A PROTEST. — The Declaration of Independence was a 
protest against the abridgment of such rights as the colonists claimed as subjects of 
the British Crown. Their anger was directed against Parliament rather than the King 
because restrictions were placed by law upon the colonists which were not imposed 
upon citizens of Great Britain residing in the mother country.  
These operated solely for the benefit of the long-established home government 
and institutions. Spurred by the spirit of independence engendered through the bitter 
experiences and necessary self-reliance required in their century-and-a-half battle to 
conquer the American wilderness, and fired by the indignities and injustice to which 
they had long been compelled to submit, they threw off the yoke of oppression and set 
up a government that would forever guard them against tyranny, however it might seek 
to impose its will.  
“When in the Course of human events. it becomes necessary for one people to 
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume 
among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of 
Nature and of Nature's God entitled them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind 
requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation — We 
hold these truths to be self-evident. that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, 
Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. And for the support of this Declaration, with a 
firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other 
our Lives. our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.” — Declaration of Independence. 
“ No man sought or wished for more than to defend his own. None hoped to 
plunder or spoil * * * and we all know that it could not have lived a single day under 
any well-founded imputation of passion.” — Webster. 
PAGE 32 
Its enemies. — The "enemies within" who would make the Declaration of Independence 
a mockery play one group of Americans against another. They fan the flames of 
prejudice. They magnify fancied evils of injustices to the ignorant. They distort its 
language to suit their own ends so cleverly that many of the less informed follow them 
in the name of Americanism. 
Its survival. — Every American citizen must be constantly on guard if the principles 
set forth in the Declaration of Independence are to survive. 
LIBERTY DEFINED. — There are two kinds of liberty — absolute liberty: That of the 
democracy, in which any individual may act as he pleases by mob rule; and civil liberty: 
That of a civilized community in which human actions are regulated by law for the good 
of all — subject only to such restraints as a solemn and tolerant judgment determines 
to be essential. 
Political liberty is no other than natural liberty so far restrained by human laws 
and no further, as is necessary and expedient for the general advantage of the public. 
— Blackstone. 
Liberty does not free the people from the necessity for control, but it places a 
heavy burden of responsibility upon the individual for self-control. It is not a license to 
do as one pleases. Through developed “intelligence" man has power to control his 
baser and more selfish instincts, compelling their exercise and restriction in the 
interest of society.  
Minority control exercises its will until such time as general intelligence becomes 
sufficiently informed to establish an order of society with a larger and more even 
distribution of benefit to all, and the law of will (force) is supplanted by the law of 
reason. As defined in the Preamble to the American Constitution, liberty is the absence 
PAGE 33 
of arbitrary human restraints upon personal conduct other than those imposed by the 
authority of just laws, obedience to which is an essential part of it. 
Fundamental law. — The rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit happiness are beyond 
the right of any government to legally usurp of or infringe. 
To secure this (liberty) is the main business of governments and the reason for their 
institution. If they fall in this, they have failed in all. — Blackstone. 
These principles were written by our fathers into a constitution of government, for the 
first time in human history, when they wrote the Constitution and it became the 
fundamental law of a new nation dedicated to the proposition that "all men are created 
equal" and that "government derives its just powers from the consent of the 
governed." 
PERSONAL LIBERTY. — Freedom of action. — Every citizen is on an equal footing as to 
privileges and opportunity. Any denial of such rights results from either the limited 
ability of the individual to take full advantage of opportunity, or because of prejudices 
in no way a part of the ruling law of our land.  
Born free citizens, or acquiring that right through naturalization, we have full 
freedom of action — without infringement upon the rights of others — to reside or 
travel at home or abroad under the protection and with all privileges accorded by our 
Government, regardless of race, color, religion, or social station.  
Full opportunity is here given to every citizen to work out his own ideals and ideas. 
To the native born this privilege is accepted as a matter of no great significance, for 
he is wholly unfamiliar with the laws, traditions, and customs that direct and restrict 
individual action of citizens in foreign countries. 
PAGE 34 
The American citizen frequently changes his occupation. His very liberty keeps 
him on the alert for an opportunity to better his financial or social status. The change 
is one of occupation, not of personality; his pride and self-respect are not involved. 
 RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. — No greater liberty was ever conferred on a people than that of 
freedom to worship according to the dictates of one's own conscience. The first 
amendment to the American Constitution declares that:  
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibit 
the free exercise thereof."  
All persons have the privilege to entertain any religious belief, practice any 
religious rite, teach any religious doctrine, which is not subversive of morality and 
does not interfere with the personal rights of others.  
However, this liberty cannot be "invoked as a protection against legislation for 
the punishment of acts inimical to the peace, good order, and morals of society," 
because professed doctrines of religious belief are not superior to the laws of the land. 
No person is permitted to become a law unto himself, nor may any person in the name 
of religion, or through a religious ceremony, violate the law. 
Religion and national defense. — There is no place for the doctrine of "noncooperation." 
Religious beliefs will not excuse any citizen from rendering service in the defense of 
the country, although Congress has power at its discretion to exempt him. 
 FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND PRESS. — The right to act, to think, to speak, to print, is the surest 
way to protect the liberties, and continue the full measure of independence which 
America so richly possesses. In these rights lies the means of creating a public opinion 
representative of the entire Nation.  
PAGE 35 
This liberty is indispensable to further social, economic, and political 
development. Clash of opinions creates interest and thought on all public questions. A 
realization of the force of public opinion expressed by the ballot, awakens a sense of 
responsibility that compels the best minds to careful study to any subject that vitally 
concerns our Nation. give Through the present means of communication, the people 
are daily informed in every matter of national or international import. 
Abuses. — This privilege does not permit the publication of libels or other matter 
injurious to public morals or private reputation. Like all liberties granted under the 
broad principles of the American Constitution, these rights are abused to the detriment 
of the best interests of the people. 
Restriction of abuses. — There is no law in any state or nation that prohibits freedom 
of speech or press, but there are laws against the abuse of this right. Restrictions may 
be necessary for the preservation of public order and the protection of the State. While 
Congress is forbidden by the American Constitution to abridge the freedom of speech 
or the press, the punishment of those who violate every principle of loyalty and 
patriotism modifies in no manner the constitutional provision. The law punishes 
because of the crime against the country and its citizens. 
The first amendment "cannot have been, and obviously was not, intended to give 
immunity for every possible use of language." — Justice Holmes. 
Blackstone's maxims, which help to interpret the present limitation on speech and 
press: 
(1) Between public and private rights, the public rights must prevail. 
(2) Liberty to all, but preference to none. 
PAGE 36 
(3) Those offenses should be most severely punished which are most difficult to guard 
against 
 ECONOMIC LIBERTY. — Property rights safeguarded. — Under no other government are 
property rights of the individual so provided with safeguards' for their full protection. 
Property is at the base of civilization. Without incentive of right to its private 
possession and full protection against confiscation no progress would be made in 
material betterment. 
Economic liberty, the power of initiative, and the protection of property rights have 
developed a philosophy of life peculiar to America — the "dignity of work." Every 
American is expected to be a worker. 
Based upon the constitutional assurance of the security of property, finance and labor 
have joined in the creation of industry, making America the richest nation in the world. 
Her wealth has been distributed to the enrichment of her entire population. 
Political liberty. — Equal participation. — The list of public- office holders in city, State, 
and Nation reveals the measure of political liberty granted in America. There are found 
representatives of practically every race in the world. They have been elected by the 
people as their able and honorable representatives. Every citizen enjoys the protection 
and benefits of our municipal, State, and National Governments.  
Any suggestion of racial or religious differences is frowned upon. It is the sincere 
wish of the majority that tolerance and understanding weld our people of all 
nationalities into a social, economic, and political unity for the purpose of developing a 
strong national character and a race of men and women whose ideals and attainments 
shall be an inspiration and help to the peoples of all the earth. The greatest degree of 
political liberty is secured by wise laws properly enforced. Anarchy destroys liberty 
because it is lawlessness and confusion, and utter disregard of all government. 
Safeguards to our liberties. — By clinging to the ideas and ideals which 
animated the framers of the Declaration of Independence, we can assure not only 
peace within, but national security and respect from other nations. When we fail to 
adequately comprehend the principles incident to our government, its fundamental 
ideals which have made our Government, the United States of America faces anarchy 
and destruction. 
Let our object be our country, our whole country, and nothing but our country, 
and by the blessing of God may that country itself become a vast and splendid 
monument, not of oppression and terror, but of wisdom, of peace, and of liberty, upon 
which the world may gaze with admiration forever. — Webster, 
THE PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT 
The purpose of government. — A correct understanding of the purposes of 
government furnishes a remedy for erroneous and dangerous ideas threatening this 
Government of laws. — Until the adoption of a constitution, government was 
imposed by the will of the minority and enforced by absolute control of economic 
institutions and military forces. Under a constitution a "Government of laws and not of 
men" was formulated out of the experiences of the centuries in which feudalism, 
despotism, autocracy had given form to the ruling forces of government. 
Sources of the American Constitution. — The underlying principles of the 
Constitution were not formulated in a day. The three great American charters of liberty 
contained the fundamental principles of American government: "Bill for establishing 
religious freedom in Virginia," "Virginia Bill of Rights," and "Declaration of 
Independence." Before the Constitutional Convention met in Philadelphia, many plans 
and suggestions were drafted and presented to the convention. 
PAGE 37 
PAGE 38 
country. Government is instituted for the common benefit, maintaining order, and 
protecting life, liberty, and property. To secure liberty is the main business of 
governments and the reason for their institution. — Blackstone. 
THE PREAMBLE TO THE CONSTITUTION. — The Preamble to the Constitution is a most 
accurate and comprehensive statement of the purpose of government. It explicitly sets 
forth the fundamental purposes for which government is primarily organized. The 
brevity, simplicity, and directness of its original draft, after 150 years of experience, 
require no change.  
We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, 
establish Justice, insure Domestic Tranquility, provide for the Common Defense, 
promote the General Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our 
Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution of the United States of America. — 
Preamble to the Constitution. 
"We, the people." — The convention, which met in Philadelphia in 1787, adopted a 
Constitution based upon the proposition that a people can govern themselves. Under 
the Articles of Confederation, the State assumed control. A single State might exercise 
veto power over the will of all the others. In the government set up under the new 
Constitution the power and rights of the people are the source and final authority.  
It derives its "just powers from the consent of the governed." For the first time 
in human history "the people" assumed control and government became subject to 
their will. Nowhere is American independence and self-reliance better exemplified than 
in the words, 
 "We, the people." The people, the highest authority known to our system, from 
whom all our institutions spring and upon whom they depend, formed it. — President 
Monroe. 
PAGE 39 
"A more perfect Union." — In the original federation the States were but loosely 
joined. The Constitution was a demand for more effective control of the Union by the 
Government. In the efficacy and permanency of your Union a government for the whole 
is indispensable * * *. You have improved upon your first essay (Articles of 
Confederation) by the adoption of a constitution of government « » » for the 
efficacious management of your common concerns. * * * Indignantly frown upon the 
first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or 
to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts. — Washington 
— Farewell Address. 
"Justice." — Our government assures "justice" in that it is a government of laws, 
not of men. In the heat of passion or sectional interest, in clashes between groups or 
questions of policy, no minority or bloc may enforce its will. Should a majority seek to 
injure the rights of an individual citizen, the power of veto resting in the President, or 
the power of the Supreme Court as an unbiased tribunal, will insist that justice be done. 
A series of checks and balances, which prevent the selfish interests of either 
individuals or groups from exercising their will to the injustice of another, is provided 
by the Constitution. 
General welfare." — The National Government . Possessed of its own natural 
resources, in the development of which it is necessary for its own best interests to 
have the full cooperation of every, other State in exchange of raw materials, finished 
products, and farm produce. Its great land areas and mighty rivers are frequently the 
concern of several States or of the entire Nation. It is within the power of Congress to 
appropriate funds for constructing canals, river and harbor development, and control 
irrigation. projects where more than one State is interested, hard roads, and 
Postal Service; to regulate communications and transportation; and, through 
its various departments, perform such other services as will result in benefit to all 
citizens. This is not paternalism, but that protection of person and property which 
enables the citizen to obtain the greatest possible returns in the exercise of his own 
initiative. 
"Blessings of liberty." — To secure the "blessings" of liberty was the 
fundamental purpose of the makers of the Constitution and its subsequent adoption. 
They include all the rights and privileges that a citizen of this country enjoys — a voice 
in the Government; freedom to worship according to the dictates of the individual 
conscience; freedom of speech and of the press; the lack of restriction upon all 
inherent individual rights. The liberty of America is not that which permits the individual 
citizen to do as he pleases. He may so long as he does not interfere with the liberty of 
others. The liberty of the individual ends where the rights of others begin. 
emphasizes that —(1) Individual rights are sacred and it is necessary to establish a 
government in the protection of these rights. (2) All the powers of government are 
The "blessings" which the citizen enjoys under our form of government are 
secured through "liberty under law," the enforcement of which is their only safeguard. 
The purpose of our Government is to protect (not to provide) the property of its 
citizens; to guard his person (not to provide his subsistence) while he acquires the 
means of livelihood; to give every citizen equal opportunity in his chosen work and 
assure him of equal standing before the law. 
Our Government is the most nearly perfect of all in securing individual rights and 
insuring the blessings of liberty. In no other nation is equal opportunity and equal 
protection assured, with such equal division of reward for labor and services rendered.  
THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY OF GOVERNMENT. — The American philosophy of government 
PAGE 40 
PAGE 41 
derived from the people, who retain the supreme authority over all delegated powers 
of government. (3) Individual rights are not permitted to be exercised in the 
contravention of the rights of society. Individual liberty is always bounded by social 
obligations. (4) Government is exercised for the purpose of protecting the individual in 
his rights. (5) Governmental powers are delegated to the National, State, or local 
authority, and are limited in their exercise by provisions of the Constitution as 
interpreted and defined by the Supreme Court. (6) All rights not thus delegated are 
recognized as the inviolable right of the individual citizen and cannot be usurped by any 
governmental power. (7) The Government of the United States is not a democracy but 
a Republic. The National Republic of the United States of America. 
REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT. — The American experiment. — A few races qualified 
themselves for self-government. To establish that form of government was a long, hard 
struggle which culminated in the great American experiment. The United States set up 
a distinct and different form of government, the product of distinct racial stocks and 
centuries spent in learning the principles and art of self-government. In practice, our 
form of government is the most nearly perfect in securing individual rights and 
ensuring the blessings of liberty. It differs from previous forms in certain vital and 
fundamental principles which have come to be known as "American institutions." 
Among these is that of self-government by representation, which is "the golden mean 
between autocracy and democracy." 
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS. — The following comparative analysis shows the principal 
characteristics of the three forms of government: 
Autocracy: Authority is derived through heredity. People have no choice in the 
selection of their rulers and no voice in making of the laws. Could results in if no Moral 
law within the Autocracy:  arbitrariness, tyranny, and oppression, feudalistic. 
PAGE 42 
DEMOCRACY: A government of the masses. Authority derived through mass 
meeting or any other form of “direct" expression. Results, in mobocracy. Attitude 
toward property is communistic — negating property rights. Attitude toward law is 
that the will of the majority shall regulate, whether it be based upon deliberation or 
governed by passion, prejudice, and impulse, without restraint or regard to 
consequences. Results in demagogism, license, agitation, discontent, anarchy, 
Carnality, etc. 
REPUBLIC: 
Authority is derived through the election by the people of public officials best 
fitted to represent them. Attitude toward property is respect for laws and individual 
rights, and a sensible economic procedure. Attitude toward law is the administration 
of justice in accord with fixed principles and established evidence, with a strict regard 
to consequences. A greater number of citizens and extent of territory may be brought 
within its compass. Avoids the dangerous extreme of either tyranny or mobocracy. 
Results in statesmanship, liberty, reason, justice, contentment, and progress. Is the 
"standard form" of government throughout the world.  
A republic is a form of government under a constitution which provides the 
election of (1) an executive and (2) a legislative body, who working for together in a 
representative capacity, have all the power of appointment, all power of legislation, all 
power to raise revenue and appropriate expenditures, and are required to create (3) 
a judiciary to pass upon the justice and legality of their governmental acts and to 
recognize (4) certain inherent individual rights. 
PAGE 43 
 Take away any one or more of those four elements and you are drifting into 
autocracy. Add one or more to those four elements and you are drifting into democracy. 
— Atwood. 
Democracy is the "direct" rule of the people and has been repeatedly tried 
without success. 
Our Constitutional fathers, familiar with the strength and weakness of both 
autocracy and democracy, with fixed principles in mind, defined a representative 
republican form of government. They "made a very marked distinction between a 
republic and a democracy * * * and said repeatedly and emphatically that they had 
founded a republic." Madison, in the Federalist, emphasized the fact that this 
government was a republic and not a democracy, the Constitution makers having 
considered both an autocracy and a democracy as undesirable forms of government 
while "a republic * * * promises the cure for which we are seeking." 
In a democracy the people meet and exercise the government in person. In a 
republic they assemble and administer it by their respective agents. — Madison. 
The advantage which a republic has over a democracy consists in the substitution 
of representatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render them 
superior to local prejudices and to schemes of injustice. — Madison. 
The American form of government is the oldest republican form of government 
in the world and is exercising a pronounced influence in modifying the governments of 
other nations. Our Constitution has been copied in whole or in part throughout the 
earth.  
No direct action. — Under the representative form of government there is no 
place for "direct action." The inherent characteristic of a republic is government by 
representation. The people are permitted to do only two things; they may vote once 
every four years for the executive and once in two years for members of the legislative 
body. 
Methods of representative government. — Constitutional government may be set 
up under either a written or an unwritten Constitution. 
An unwritten constitution. — An unwritten constitution consists largely of 
customs, precedents, conditions, and understandings, and is constantly changing; any 
party in power may enact legislation materially affecting the methods of government 
and the political rights of citizens. 
A written constitution. — In the United States the rights of the people are fully 
protected and the functions of government strictly defined in a written document — 
the Constitution. It is called a “rigid Constitution" because the legislative power has no 
authority to change it. It is subject to amendment only by the authority and action of 
the people through their representatives in Congress. The Congress, whenever two
thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this 
Constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several 
states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which in either case, shall 
be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the 
legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three-fourths 
thereof, as one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress; 
provided* * * that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage 
in the Senate. — Constitution, Article V. 
As a wall of protection our written Constitutions i.e., American Constitution and 
National Government’s Divine Constitution & By-Laws,  stands between the people and 
PAGE 44 
those who, through lust for power, or the temporary passions of the moment, or for 
any other reason, would trespass upon the rights of person or property.  Consent of 
the governed. — The original desire of the colonists was "only to have a voice" in the 
affairs of the Government. Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just 
powers from the consent of the governed * * *.  
— Declaration of Independence. The situation so developed that the colonists 
totally dissolved "all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain," 
and established a new form of government based upon the "consent of the governed." 
"Consent" in the drafting and approval of the instrument of government and its 
subsequent amendment was a new feature. 
Subsequently, many of these features were incorporated in the first10 
amendments, adopted in 1791 as supplements to the Constitution, and are called the 
"American Bill of Rights." — When the Constitutional Convention was ending 
several members who opposed the adoption of the Constitution suggested several 
amendments, which, they declared, "would make the Constitution acceptable to them." 
While the Constitution already contained many provisions for the protection of the 
rights of the individual citizen, various States desired that it contain further written 
stipulations that would remove every possibility of doubt and prevent disputes by 
"leaving no matters to inference, implication, or construction." It was contended that 
the provision of the suggested Bill of Rights contained "various exceptions not granted 
* * *. 
Why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?" The 
tyranny of legislature is a most formidable dread at present and will be for many years. 
That of the Executive will come in its time, but it will be at a remote period. — Madison. 
PAGE 45 
PAGE 46 
"American Bill of Rights." The first 10 amendments embodied "guaranties and 
immunities ...." — Supreme Court (1897).  
 Enumeration of constitutional rights. — Individual rights formally guarded by 
original constitutional provisions: No ex-post facto laws. No bill of attainder. No 
suspension of privileges of habeas corpus. Trial by jury and at places where the crimes 
were committed. Definition of treason and limiting punishment. Guaranty of immunity 
and privileges of all States to the citizens of each State. No religious test before 
admission to public office. 
To which the Bill of Rights added: 
Right of peaceable assembly and petition to the Government for redress of 
grievances. Freedom of religion, speech, and press. Right of the people to keep and 
bear arms — militia. Quartering of soldiers only as provided by law. Protection against 
unreasonable searches. Right of accused to indictment by grand jury with certain 
exceptions. No compulsory testimony against self. No deprivation of rights without due 
process of law. No confiscation of private property for public use without just 
compensation. Right of a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury. Right to demand 
information concerning the nature and cause of accusation.  
To be confronted with witnesses against him. Compulsory process for obtaining 
witnesses in his favor. Have assistance of counsel for defense. Right of trial by jury in 
suits of common law where value and controversy shall exceed $20. Protection of 
verdict of said jury. No excessive bail required.  
No imposition of excessive fines. No infliction of cruel and unusual punishment. 
Rights retained by the people shall not be denied nor disparaged. Powers not delegated 
to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved 
to the States or to the people. 
PAGE 47 
 GOVERNMENT BY REPRESENTATION. — The framers of the Constitution were opposed to 
direct government. The remedy sought was to be found in representative government. 
Madison declared that the object to which their efforts wore to be directed was how 
to prevent a majority rule and to preserve the spirit and form of popular government. 
The representative form of government was their answer.  
The United States shall guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form 
of government. — Constitution, Article IV, section 4. 
 
NATIONAL CHARACTER. —  
National character is the sum of every citizen. The Nation has a right to expect 
each citizen to maintain high ideals, and he has a right to expect the same of his 
neighbor. The resulting measure of satisfaction should spur any right-thinking 
individual to such attainment. The actual worth of a citizen to himself, his community, 
his country, regardless of any other accomplishment, is based on the high quality and 
standard of his thinking. Obedience to higher impulses builds up self-respect without 
which no true success is possible. 
Community and home. — The United States has been developed by a succession 
of communities, independent of each other, yet closely related in their social, economic, 
and political interests. The character of the community is determined by the character 
of its homes and the character of its homes is determined by the character of the 
individual citizen. He is the only person upon whom responsibility for community and 
home can be placed.  
Importance of active citizenship. — Good government is the responsibility of the 
individual citizen in whom final authority is vested. It will be no higher in its ideals nor 
PAGE 48 
just in its administration than the sum of our national character. The first and 
paramount duty of every citizen is to have a firsthand knowledge of the Constitution of 
the United States. He should learn the accurate, comprehensive, and masterly 
statement of the six principles of government as contained in the Preamble, and the 
plan for setting up and maintaining our representative form of government. It is in this 
document that individual rights and fundamental duties are set forth. 
 Law and order. — The best government is that in which justice is most evenly 
administered. The better our government, the more prosperous and contented the 
people. Every time the citizen assists the administration of justice, he makes a material 
contribution to the welfare of all. Every citizen should observe and respect the law. It 
is no excuse that if a certain law interferes with his personal habits, desires, or beliefs 
he should disregard it. Absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority when 
legally expressed is the vital principle of republics. It is your personal responsibility 
not to contribute to the defeat of justice either by evading the law or consenting to its 
evasion by others. Statutory laws are presumed to be just and for the benefit of all 
law-abiding citizens. No greater responsibility rests upon the citizen than to demand 
just laws and their enforcement. There is nothing more degrading, more destructive in 
its effect upon personal honor and character, than evasion of law, bribery of officers, 
or contributing to the delinquency of others. 
Public opinion. — Within each community there is an invisible, government which 
we call "public opinion." Without this force our courts and police would be powerless 
in their effort to control. Only in proportion as public opinion backs the law can it or 
will it be enforced. To protect the land from the overflow of our great rivers we erect 
dikes along their banks. The moment a "sand boil" appears behind a dike a crew is 
rushed to the place, and repairs are made to prevent a break that might bring disaster 
to thousands. Public opinion, expressing the true character of home and community, is 
PAGE 49 
the dike that protects America from the overflow of crime, immorality, irreligion, and 
injustice, which, if allowed to break through, will do an irreparable damage to the free 
institutions of America. 
Public opinion reaches an uncommonly high level because every citizen is called 
upon to express his own judgment in community and national affairs, and to work for 
the betterment of his town, county, State, and country. It is your personal responsibility 
to mold and control public opinion. 
RESPONSIBILITY cannot be transferred. — "Responsibilities gravitate to the man 
who can shoulder them and power flows to the man who knows how." The recognition 
of the inequality of ability and the equality of moral obligation makes individual 
responsibility distasteful to the defective citizen. Efforts are being made to supplant 
the individual responsibility of American citizens with "State responsibility" which 
destroys self-respect, ambition, and national character. It demands "State control" 
which not only promises to relieve the citizen of his individual responsibility, but it also 
deprives the individual citizen of his personal liberties. It is the duty of every American 
citizen to prevent the destruction of our Republic and individualistic form of 
government by any such destructive political philosophy. -The closing words of the Declaration of Independence reveal the seriousness 
with which the signers fulfilled their personal responsibility: “...For the support of this 
Declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually 
pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor...” 
FREEDOM NOT A GIFT. — Freedom is not a gift. It has been bought and paid for in the 
sacrifices of peace and war. It is laid in long hours of toil, the swing of the ax in the 
forest, the campfire of the lonely pioneer, the sod house of the early settler, the 
community stockade and the frontier Army post. Freedom has traveled a long, hard 
PAGE 50 
road. None but the strong and courageous have possessed it and by no others can it 
be retained. 
PREPAREDNESS AN AGENCY FOR PEACE. — The desire for peace is the spirit of America, 
but that peace must be dynamic, not a peace characterized by weakness of purpose 
or lack of courage. 
MORAL QUALITIES ESSENTIAL TO SELF-PRESERVATION. — The American citizen 
must emphasize those qualities of character which mark him as truly worthy of the 
privileges of independence and liberty. His claim to self-respect is sound only as he 
upholds the self-respect of his fellow citizens. His honor is sacred only as he protects 
the honor of his country. He values liberty and independence only in so far as he is 
willing to pay the price for its protection. 
“...We mutually pledge our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor...” — Signers 
of the Declaration of Independence. 
The moral qualities essential to self-preservation are —implementing the 
attributes of Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom, and Justice; The will to win, where it does 
not compromise your morals. The courage to endure. The willingness to die for the 
principles of your vine and fig tree. 
CIVIC DEFINITIONS: 
Nation means A people, or aggregation of men, existing in the form of an 
organized jural society, inhabiting a distinct portion of the earth, speaking the same 
language, using the same customs, possessing historic continuity, and distinguished 
from other like groups by their racial origin and characteristics, and generally, but not 
necessarily, living under the same government and sovereignty. See Montoya v. U. S.,

Rep. 744. Besides the element of autonomy or self-government, that is, the 
independence of the community as a whole from the interference of any foreign power 
in its affairs or any subjection to such power, it is further necessary to the constitution 
of a nation that it should be an organized jural society, that is, both governing its own 
members by regular laws, and defining and protecting their rights, and respecting the 
rights and duties which attach to it as a constituent member of the family of nations.

PRELUDE 
‘Asiatic race;’ from 1900 to 19091 were suffering from a mental disability. MOORS of 
the Northwest were MARKED Negros, Colored Folks, Black People or Ethiopians, by 
Europeans nations in 1774; names given to slaves by slave holders in 1779 until 1865 
during the times of slavery. MOORS have been suffering from Mental Slavery and 
were lost to their nationality after the momentous event of 1774. MOORS were forced 
under Christianity and Codes and found themselves un-der duress, corrosion, and 
threat, handicapped into the 14th Amendment citizenship as a person, i.e., Black 
people, Negros, Latinos, etc. 2nd class citizens and were living as such until the advent 
of our holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali, our forefather and parent born in 1886 in the 
state of North Carolina. 
Our Holy Messiah was born in the state of North Carolina 1886 “Jesus in the person 
of Noble Drew Ali.” 
“Every Nation was sent a Rasool. Once their Rasool came, judgment was passed 
between them with all fairness, and they were not wronged in the least.” HQM2-Yunus 
10:47 
“The Negro is crying out for a Mohammed. A Prophet to come forth and to give 
him the Koran of economic and intellectual welfare. Where is he?!!” -The Forerunner, 
Marcus M. Garvey- 
“I am the fifth and last Prophet, and I am five times more powerful than I was 
before.” -Prophet Drew Ali

By the act of Love Allah has distinguished to the Asiatic of the Americas with a 
particular favor; as he has given this distinction to other Nations (Sura 14:4) and (1Peter 
2:4-10)This blessing was, the coming of a Prophet, a Messenger for they are a chosen 
generation a royal priesthood; a holy Nation.  
We are never too bold to question how Allah sees fit to guide or leave stray a 
people or nation. Confirmation that Allah sends prophets (messengers) to the 
people, of that prophet’s nation or people; no matter what era in time and they are 
always the seal of their time. (See Surah 14:4 in the Holy Quran) 4.“We did not send a 
Messager except (to teach) in the language of his (own) people, in order to make 
(things) clear to them. Now Allah leaves straying those whom he pleases and guides 
whom He pleases: and He is Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom.” 
In the language of his own people... this statement is especially important it 
implies that prophets are sent to ‘their people’ speaking the language that they (the 
prophet) grew up with3. 
As we see in the Holy Quran of Mecca Surah 14:5-6,9. 
5.“We sent Moses with Our Signs (and the Command)...6. Remember! Moses said to 
his people...” 
9.“Has not the story reached you (O people!), of those who (went) before you? – of the people of Noah, and Ad, and Thamud...? ” 
Surah 10:47 To every people an Apostle: (Messager), when their Apostle comes, the 
matter will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged.

As we can see those who follow the Islamic religion; Allah sends every people or 
nation a Prophet (Messager, Apostle) to lead them right. As is the case with the fallen 
sons and daughters of the Asiatic race of North America etc. who were strip of their 
language, history, their nationality, religion, and cultural achievements and 
contributions to civilization, during the times of slavery in North America from 1779 
until 1865; and believed themselves to be Negros, Latinos, Colored People, and African 
Americans to this very day.

governing a portion of Amexem (America) at this time.  
1891- 1901- CHILDHOOD 
The prophet was born Timothy Drew, little is known about his childhood. What is 
known is fragmented; it is told by our Moorish Elders that; Timothy Drew was born to a 
Cherokee Mother {one of the five civilized tribes of Moors} and his Father was an ex
slave (called a Negro, his true identity, Moorish decent). It was said that he was raised 
by his Cherokee family until 1892. Timothy moved to Newark, New Jersey, and it is here 
in Newark were his mother died. Timothy Drew went to live with an aunt. 
As the events unfold; she was a heartless forbidding woman, who tried to push 
him into a fire filled furnace and it was the Father-God Allah who sheltered him from 
the fire. He is said to have scars from this incident. Young Timothy Drew left 
immediately after that and began traveling as a young teenager. It is said that young 
Timothy had uncanny abilities, these gifts from Allah were most mistaken as magic. 
These abilities landed him a job in the traveling circus, where he demonstrated 
levitation and clairvoyance abilities. During his international travels as a merchant 
seaman, young Timothy heard a voice speak to him with authority yet with a stillness 
and peace; “Go! Where You Go, I Go, I Am with You.” 
1901- 1909-THE HIEROPHANT OF EGYPT 
With his Heart guiding him he boarded a ship to the Mediterranean Sea. By the 
age of 15 or 16 Timothy Drew was in Africa, Egypt was his divine destiny, A destiny holy 
and glorious unfolding as the African lotus unfolds on the Nile. Here he would live and 
be instructed, “…prepared divinely in due time by Allah…” He was recognized by an

Adept Master Minds, Gurus who were said to have been from Punjab, India, and Egypt. 
Young Timothy was taken into the great pyramid of Khufu, with eyes bound and was 
released to find his way out unassisted or die.  
They say at dawn he appeared from the sand in between the paws of Heru 
(Sphinx). After about 10 years of applied Adept sciences, he became the Light of 
Moorish Science; he was titled by the Adept Master Minds ‘Angel of Allah’. Young Timothy 
was received in the Holy City of Mecca as a Moslem, one of the highest degrees the 
Chief Protectors of the Creed of Islam could give. Timothy Drew was exalted and given 
his holy name and Nobility title back, while in the Holy City of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. 
“El Hajj Sharif Abdul Ali” and hajj was, in Mecca. Also, he was known as Sheik 
Sharif Abdul Ali. El Hajj Sharif Abdul Ali: Noble Drew Ali the Egyptian Adept student; at 
this time, traveled. He was approximately 25 years old.

It is also reported around 1910- 1 with his exulted authority he met and made 
alliances with Sultan Abdul Aziz Ibu Saud now THE HEAD of the Holy City of Mecca, Sultan 
Fuad of Egypt, and the Grand Lodge of England-France. It is also reported he traveled 
with one by the name of Suleiman Mohammed the head Egyptian Adept Master and Abdul 
Karim El of Morocco and Duce Mohammed Ali an Egyptian Master.  
With a mighty Thought and consciousness of his mission to the sons of men, in 
the spring of 1911 Noble Drew Ali returned to America to fulfill his duty as an Angle of 
Allah. Noble Drew Ali the Egyptian Adept student was given many sacred books unfolding 
the creations of the worlds, the true history of Man, human, and mankind; he was taught

the Laws that govern all events. He was enlightened to all the true teaching of all the 
Prophets of all the Ages and climes. He had placed to memory these divine books. 
“I got here just in time” the Prophet said that ‘the Europeans were looking for 
him with airplanes and with dread-naught.’ 
NOBLE DREW ALI THE EGYPTIAN ADEPT STUDENT 1912 
When he came back into the United States he was asked “where are those books 
that you have?” The Holy prophet just smiled; he told the Moors that “the books were 
in his head.” The Holy Prophet as the rising Phoenix in the West arrives back in the 
states from the east.  
While in the United States the Holy Prophet worked as a Porter on the B&Q 
Railroad for an abbreviated time. As a porter Noble Drew Ali encountered an intelligent 
Mind, one J. A. Rogers and the Holy Prophet began to enlighten J. A. Rogers about his 
RETRIEVING THE MOORISH FLAG 
forefather’s divine history. Soon after his divine meetings with the Prophet, J. A. 
Rogers authored the book “From Superman to Man”. He gave honors to Noble Drew Ali 
cloaked under the pseudonym ‘Dixon’ a wise Negro porter.  
Noble Drew Ali the Egyptian Adept student, taught in Newark New Jersey for Six

Meanwhile Noble Drew Ali was teaching the old-time religion of the missing years of 
Jesus in the Bible. Prophet Noble Drew Ali went to Washington DC where he met with 
an incoming President and lawyers to reclaim our flag, all red flag with a five-pointed 
green star in the center interlocking, which was taken down during the colonial times 
by George Washington (famous Cherry tree). Many people are unaware of the 
importance of our Prophet’s action on this date in 1912 here in America. Others are 
unclear as to the reason for our usage of the same flag flown by Moroccans in Africa. 
Briefly it must be understood in the year of 1912 in the month of March because 
of actions taken by European countries as well as the Sultan of Morocco was stripped 
of its right to rule itself. With that came the removal of the Moroccan flag, this was 
then just a plain piece of red cloth. ] This can be verified in a flag book]. In the same 
month Prophet Noble Drew Ali went to Washington DC where he met with the President 
to reclaim our flag, all red flag with a five-pointed green star in the center, which was 
taken down during the colonial times.  
Because of the Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali’s action, Moors here in America were 
able to display with pride our ancient flag during the years when Moroccans could not 
1912-1956. Therefore, March 17th is recognized as Moorish Tag Day, which celebrates 
the return of the five-pointed green star to our flag here on U.S.A. soil, as the Moorish 
flag’s return to the world via Prophet Noble Drew Ali’s Divine work in America. Upon its 
independences in March 1956, the constitutional monarchy of Morocco adopted the red 
flag with the five-pointed green star in the center over-lapping as its National symbol 
of freedom and self-determination.

“MASTERPIECE OF RELIGIOUS LITERATURE: 
Holy Koran divinely prepared by the Noble Prophet Drew Ali 1927 
SECRETS OF OTHER CREEDS REVEALED” BY PROPHET NOBLE DREW ALI REPRINTED 
FROM THE MOORISH GUIDE  FRIDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1928  
The Prophet Noble Drew Ali has spent many hours preparing the latest edition of 
the Koran, which will be a masterpiece of religious Literature. To Americanize the 
Oriental idea of Islam involves much change that is more or less negative to the aim 
purpose carefully considered with the idea to avoid changing the complexion of the 
original text. The Philosophy of the ancient Prophets is the main initiative in the 
compilation of the Koran. No thoughts of propaganda enter this work, as has been the 
case of many former religious works, such as the Bible and other books of creed. The 
sole purpose of the Prophet in giving such a message to the world is to save fallen 
humanity.  
When a compiler attempts to inject propaganda into a work of this kind, there 
arises a need to cover the true text in order to prevent a clash with the truth and ideas 
involved in such propaganda. Former work of this kind has either hindered or helped 
the nations proportionately to the adherence to the truth and to the original purpose 
of keeping the ignorant in such a state. It is hard to resist the temptation to use this 
medium for gain.  
Hence, many of the former treaties in works of this kind have been the means to 
foster ideas of the unscrupulous wherein they desire to use religious influence for gain.

The many secrets known to the Prophet that could be used for the salvation of the 
nation were either let out or colored to an extent that their meaning was made void.

to man are put into this work. The secrets, known only to the Magi, are revealed here:

of the span of life and other such as has been kept from the occidental world are in 
this book boldly brought out. The Koran, Americanized, as it will be, can be bought in a 
few weeks. It will be sent to all Governors of The Moorish Science Temples of America.

Alderman is in and around March 1928, i.e., Charles L. Turpin Alderman of the Forth 
Ward Chicago Ill., Dr. George W. Prince Alderman of the Fourth Ward etc.  
In February 1928 Prophet Drew Ali made his historic trip to Habana Cuba to 
represent the Moorish Americans at the sixth annual Convention of the American 
states known as the Bustamante Codes today. Private International Law used by 
Moorish Americans and Nationals today. 
Moorish elders inform us that the Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali and Bro. C. 
Kirkman Bey went to the Pan American Conference in and around February 1928. At 
that time, the Holy Prophet went there and represented the Moorish Americans, and 
there was an Indian Chief representing the American Indians. The Conference was in 
Havana, Cuba, and the nations of North, South, and Central America were present. 
Secretary of State Hughes of the United States was representing the United States at 
the conference. Bro. Charles Kirkman-Bey, who spoke three different languages, was 
the interpreter for the Holy Prophet at this conference. When the Holy Prophet ship 
was tied up at the dock, the Cuban army was standing on the dock, and Bro. Kirkman
Bey said something to them in Spanish, and the army came to attention, and then he 
and the Holy came down from the ship. At the conference Bro. C. Kirkman-Bey address 
the conference in both Spanish and Arabic, and when the Secretary of the United States 
heard Bro. C. Kirkman-Bey translated what the Holy Prophet said, he said “That’s a 
dangerous man.”

Up to that period of time, the United States received a 50-year mandate for this 
land. At this conference, the A-Mandate8 for this land was given to Prophet Noble Drew 
Ali. Bro. G. Cook-Bey G.S. (Emeritus) of Temple One said that the Prophet Noble Drew 
Ali showed us the mandate in the Adept Chamber. The conferences were mostly dealing 
with aliens within the jurisdiction of a country and Nationality issues, which is now 
established as international law as the ‘Bustamante Codes’  
May 1st, 1928, the Prophet Noble Drew Ali set aside Pine Bluff Arkansas Temple 
No. 8. 
THE CHICAGO DEFENDER NEWSPAPER began reporting on the prophet Dew Ali’s 
magnificent work June 30th, 1928, an article entitled “Moorish leader is postmaster 
Generals Guest.” 
Around this time Julian Rosenthal (owner of Sears and Roebucks) bought the 
paper; The Chicago Defender, was a popular News Paper during the time of the Holy 
Prophet the paper began reporting on the Prophets activities. 
Prophet Noble Drew Ali. June 30th, 1928, article entitled “Moorish Leader is 
Postmaster Generals Guest.” The article mentions Moorish delegates, Pearl Ali, Mealy 
El, and J. Smalls Bey. The Chicago Defender: Saturday June 30th, 1928, the Chicago 
Defender reports “Moorish Leader is Postmaster Guest, among the prominent visitors 
to the Chicago post office this week were President Drew Ali, founder of the Moorish 
Science Temple of America… After a brief but pleasant visit with Postmaster Arthur C. 
Lueder… Afterwards President Ali expressed sincere appreciation for the courtesy 
shown him and his party by the postal authorities.” 
8An A Mandate is a mandate for land from WWI the braking up of the Ottoman Empire (Moorish) a A-Mandate in land is equal to a fee-simple. The A-Mandate the Prophet got back in 1928 at the Six 
Annual Convention of the American States in Habana Cuba was recorded in Kings County (Cook County Illinois) through the Torren system.

July 14, 1928; “Moorish Leader Makes Plans for Conclave. Beginning Oct. 15 and 
continuing through the entire week the Moorish Science Temple America, of which 
Noble Drew Ali is founder and president, will hold its first general conference at Unity 
Hall, 3140 Indiana Ave Chicago Ill. President Ali began definite plans to this end upon his 
recent return from Pine Bluff, Ark., where he spent some days lecturing at the local 
Moorish Temple.  
This organization is playing a useful and definite part in advancing the sacred 
obligations of American citizenship. Indications are that this convention will be one of 
the most interesting ever held in this city. There will be delegates from 15 different 
states where local temples have been established. There will be an interesting event in 
which men and women members will were regalia similar to that worn in eastern 
countries. A camel will be presented during the session, specific reports of the general 
work and civil accomplishment of local temples.  
Report of the business enterprises that have been established in connection with 
these temples, such as grocery and market stores in Detroit, a laundry in Pittsburgh, 
Pa. These examples of collective effort show that the members of the Moorish Temple 
and their leader have a sound economic program and are blazing a trail and making 
the pathway over which our prosperity may travel unhampered and unafraid.  
‘It must be kept in mind that no great movement can take definite shape in two 
years so as to be err proof,’ said President Ali. ‘However, through accumulation 
experience each annual convention ought to witness a more perfect and wider 
functioning organization, representing the organized experience of men and 
women member throughout the country and possibly in time the world over.’ And

President Ali said ‘‘Constructive criticisms from sympathetic friends in and 
outside of our organization are welcome’.” In an article after the convention, we 
read that on the opening day that the two Grand Governors; T. Crumby Bey of 
Pittsburg and Lomax Bey of Detroit read reports, alderman Louis B. Anderson 
gave an opening address and others such as Oscar DePriest (Congressman and 
member), Attorney’s Aaron Payne (member), Richard Ross Bey (Sheik and 
member),  
Attorney George W. Blackwell, and Claude D. Green (managing editor of the 
Moorish Guide and chairman of the convention arrangements committee) spoke. 
A Moorish parade and the announcement of the Moorish governing council also 
held interest. About this the article states: “It is reported that the prophet, the 
Supreme Executive Authority, will appoint a supreme grand council, of which he 
will be the grand chairman.  
The Supreme Council will have power and control and supervise all the 
affairs and properties of the Moorish Science Temple of America, and it will 
become sole judge of what constitutes conduct injurious to the order, peace and 
interest or welfare with its constitution and by-laws, also the rules and 
regulations made by the prophet, and shall be the sole judge of the sufficiency of 
the evidence by which such conduct is shown.  
Prophet Noble Drew Ali is being congratulated by Chicagoans of the success 
of the Moors’ first annual convention and for his splendid work in promoting the 
cause of human brotherhood The name Moorish Temple of Science was changed 
to The Moorish Science Temple of America.’

Friday, September 28, 1928, Prophet Drew Ali Speaks to the Nation, the need for 
strong Men and Women. 
“If you have race pride and love for your race, join the Moorish Science Temple 
of America and become a part of this divine movement. Then you will have power to 
redeem your race because you will know who you are and who your forefathers were, 
because where there is unity there is strength. 
“Together we stand and Divided we fall.” 
Come, good people, because I, the Prophet, was sent to redeem this nation from 
mental slavery which you now have; (We) need every one of you who thinks that your 
condition can be better. This is a field open to strong men and women to uplift the 
nation and take your affaires of men. If the European and other nations are helping me 
why not you? It is your problem.  
The “Negro” problem is being solved only as it can and that is by the Moorish 
National Divine Movement. If you have a nation, you must have a free national name in 
order to be recognized by this nation as an American citizen. This is what was meant

OCTOBER 15-20TH 1928 MOORISH SCIENCE TEMPLE OF AMERICA HELD ITS FIRST CONVENTION. 
At the First Annual Convention the Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali appointed E. Mealy 
El as the first Supreme Grand Sheik at the first National Convention and was approved 
by the Supreme Grand Council. As reported by the 1st Supreme Grand Sheik E. Mealy El 
himself. 
E. MEALY EL RECORDED IN STATE DOCUMENT: “Returning from a trip visiting other temples, 
one morning in front of the Home Office at 3140 Indiana Avenue, The Prophet said to 
me, ‘E. Mealy El, Brother Mealy, you will study up now on all of my laws to prove yourself, 
because you will have to do what I am doing. You will go around to all temples and 
report back to me. So read up on my Koran, questionnaire, Constitution, and try to be 
perfect on all subjects, so you may act intelligent along all lines of procedure.’ Twenty 
minutes later, in his office on the same occasion, the Prophet Noble Drew Ali said to 
me. 
‘I find all of them want to sit in my seat, but in my absence, which is your station. 
Then when you leave, lock the desk, and put the key in your pocket. Everyone wants to 
sit there, because that is where the money is, but I know who I want to sit there, and I 
know who I want to handle my money.’.” 
Oct. 16, 1928, first ever Moorish parade ,  
Also on October 16th, the Prophet kissed a Boy and a Girl on the head and wrapped him 
in our Moorish flag and declared us a Nation.

On October 18th he then established the body of those who would act as in the 
Supreme Grand Council. The Prophet told the Moors on Oct of 1929 
That the end of time was near, and this was why every evil spirit pone was moving 
now against him and the Movement trying to drag out the truth foundation as laid by 
him, they were causing confusion in the minds of those who would believe, and the weak 
minded and faint of heart, they were falling in line with them, {the money changers}.  
What Took place in the same year? Is when Bro. James Lomax Bey stood up in 
front of the 1,500 people and declared that the Prophet would no longer be overseeing 
movement, and he did this in front of the Prophets’ very face. 
What else took place during this period? The Prophet sadly discovered that his 
wife was in on these evil things going against him and he sent her away from him. 
Were there any other major parties involved? Yes, his then Supreme Business 
Manager Bro. Claudia D. Green Bey was also discovered as being a traitor and 
embezzler of the faith and finance and tried to sleep with the prophet’s wife. What 
happen next was some Moors took it upon themselves to get Claudia D. Green and he 
was killed. 
This placed the Prophet in harm’s way {Later on someone shot at Mr. Lomax 
during services also during this time}. What did the Europeans do? They locked up the 
Prophet and made him sit on blocks of Ice. 
Another version is they beat him and moved him from jail to jail, and when it 
looked like he was dead, the order came down to release him they thought they killed 
him but when the door racked, and his name was called they say he stood right up and

walked out of the place where they were holding him. No official charges were pressed 
against the prophet. 
How long was he locked up? For three months, and then when he came out, he 
had to go to Detroit Michigan as Lomax Bey had taken him to court to gain control over 
the Movement. What happened? Lomax lost his case and the judge turned to the Prophet 
and asked him, ‘did he want, to press counter charges,’ and the Prophet said ‘no.’ 
What took place next? The Prophet returned home, and he then went and paid for 
his own funeral. 
On October 17, 1928, the Royal Prince Drew Ali published the Generals Laws and later 
that week the Supreme laws, Rules, and Regulations. 
On Oct 18, 1928, the Prophet established the Supreme Grand Council. 
November-December of 1928 across the country Temples established Groceries, 
laundry mats, and a printing shop, also a Bank “ Binga Binga Bank.” 
Friday October 26, 1928, A Warning from the Prophet for All Governors and 
Grand Sheiks and Head Officials of All Temples Movement “Renew your acts, amend 
your ways. Because the great conference is on its way…this great Divine and National 
movement must move on according to Law, these things shall be proclaimed. There is 
no favorite in any of the Temples, for the Law is laid down and everyone who claims 
apart of the work must be governed accordingly. All are one…” Also, the Temple Tax 
Necessary was Ordered by the Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali to be paid every month 
“…The per Capita tax collection begins November 1, 1928.”  
1928 October 15-20th the first Annual Convention of the Moorish Science Temple of

Our Divine and National Movement stands for the specific grand principles of Love, 
Truth, Peace, Freedom, and Justice, and I the Prophet am applying to all loyal, faithful 
Moors, members, and the American citizen to help me in my great uplifting acts of 
uplifting fallen humanity among the Asiatic race and nation. I have suffered much and 
severely in the past through misunderstanding of what the movement was dedicated 
to. It is the Great God Allah, alone, that guides the destiny of this Divine and National 
Movement. I know all true American citizens are identified by national descent names 
to answer and apply to the free National Constitution of this free National Republic of 
the United States of America. That is why I am calling on all true national citizens to 
help me morally and financially in my great work. I am going to help this national 
government. F or without a free national name, a descent flag your forefathers, there 
is not a national divine title of the government in which we live.  –Prophet Noble Drew Ali- 
THE PROPHETS WARNING TO THE NATION FRIDAY, NOVERMBER 30, 1928  
The citizens of all free National Governments, according to their National 
Constitution, are all of one family bearing one free National name. Those who fail to 
recognize the free National name of their Constitutional Government are classed as 
undesirable and are subject to all inferior names and abuses and mistreatments that 
the citizen cares to bestow upon them.  
And it is a sin for any group of people to violate the National Government; and 
cling to the names and principles that delude, to slavery. I, the Prophet, was prepared 
by the Great God Allah, to warn my people to repent from their sinful ways, and go back 
to that state of mind to their forefathers’ Divine and National Principles- that they will

587 
be law abiders and receive their divine right as citizen according to the free national 
Constitution that was prepared for all free National being-they are to claim their own 
free National name and religion.  
There is but one issue for them to be recognized by this Government and of the 
earth, and that comes only through the connection of the Moorish Divine National 
Movement and recognized by all other nations of the world. And through it they and 
their children can receive their divine rights, unmolested by other citizens. That they 
can cast a free National ballot to the polls under the free National Constitution of the 
United States Government, and not a “Granted Privilege” as has been the existing 
condition for many generations.  
You, who doubt whether I, the Prophet, and my principles are right for the 
redemption of my people, go to those that know the law in City Hall and among the 
officials in your government and ask them under intelligent tone and they will be glad 
to render you a favorable reply; for the are gold to see me bring you out of the darkness 
into light. Money does not make a man; it is free national standers and power that make 
a man and nation. The wealth of all National governments, gold d sliver commerce, 
belong to the citizen alone; and without your national citizenship y name and principle, 
you have no true wealth. And I am herby call on all true citizens that stand for a National 
Free Government and the enforcement of the Constitution to help me in my great 
missionary work, because I need all support from all true American of the United States 
of American citizen of the United States of America.  
Help me to save my people, who have fallen from the Constitutional laws of this 
government. I am depending on your support to get them back to hem Constitutional 
fold again, that they will learn to love, Truth, Peace, Freedom, and Justice, support our 
free National Constitution of the United States of America. I love my people, and I desire

their unity and mine back to their own free national and Divine Standard, because day 
by day they have been violation the National and Constitutional Laws of their 
government by calming names and principles that are constitutional. 
If Italians, Greek, English, Chinese, Turks, and Arabians are forced to proclaim 
their free national name and religion before the Constitutional Government of the 
United States of America, it is no more than right that the law should be forced upon 
all American citizens alike. In all other governments, when a man is born and raise 
there and asked his name of national decent and name if he fails to give it is misused, 
imprisoned, or exiled.  
Any group of people who fail to answer up to the Constitutional Standards of Law 
by name principle, become to be a citizen of any government you must claim your 
National name descent. Because they place their trust upon issue and names that they 
are not a part and partial of, and nether were they formed by their forefathers. The 
word ‘Negro” deludes in Latin language to the word “nigger;” the same, the word 
“colored” deludes to anything that is painted, varnished, and dyed. And every nation 
must bear a national descent name of their forefathers, because honoring thy father 
and thy mothers, your days will be lengthened upon this earth. These names have never 
been recognized by any true American citizens of this day.  
Through your free National name, you are known and recognized by all nations 
of the earth that are recognized by (the) said national government in which they live. 
The 14th and 15th amendments brought the North and South in unity; placing the 
Southerner, which was at that time without power, with the Constitutional Body of 
power. And at that time, 1865, the free national Conational Law that was enforced since 
1774 declared by the Free National Constitution to be free and equal, since that

Constitution has never been changed, there is no need for the application of the 14th 
and 15th Amendments for the Salvation of our people and citizens.  
So, there isn’t but one supreme issue for my people to use to redeem that which 
was lost, and that is through the above statements, then the lion and the lamb can lie 
down to gather in yonder hills and neither will be harmed; because Love, Truth, Peace, 
Freedom, and Justice will be reigning in this land. In those days the United Stated will 
be one of the greatest civilized and prosperous government of the world, but if the 
above principles are not carried out by the citizen and my people in this government, 
the worst is yet to come, because the Great God of the Universe is not pleased with the 
work that are being performed in North America by my people, and this great sin must 
be removed from the land to save it from enormous earthquakes, diseases, etc.  
And I, the Prophet, do herb believe that this administration of the government 
being more wisely prepared by more genus citizen that believe in their free National 
Constitution and Laws, and through the help of such classes of citizen, I, the Prophet, 
truly believe that my people will find the true and divine way of their forefathers, and 
learn to stop serving carnal customs and merely ideas of man, that have never done 
them any good- but has always harmed them.  
So I, the prophet, an hereby calling aloud, with a divine plea, to all true American 
citizens, to help me remove this great sin which has been committed and is being 
practiced by my people in the United States of America; because they know it is not the 
true and divine way, and without understanding they have fallen from the true light into 
utter darkness of sin, and there is not a nation on earth today that will recognize them 
socially, religiously politically, economically, etc., in their present condition of 
endearment , in which they them try to force upon a civilized world,

They will not refrain from their sinful ways of action and their deeds have brought 
“Jim-Crowism, segregation” and everything that bring to human beings on earth. And 
they fought the Southerners for all these great misuses, but I have traveled in the 
South and have examined conditions there, and it I the work of my people continuously 
prating the things which bring dishonor, disgrace, and disrespect to any nation that 
lives the life. And I am hereby calling on all true American citizens for moral support 
and finance to help me in my great missionary work to bring my people out of darkness 
into marvelous light. From THE PROPHET 
Noble Drew Ali in 1929 established the Young People Moorish League and Moorish 
Businessmen’s Club Also the Sis. Auxiliary was established. Noble Drew Ali sends 
Marriage LAWS to all Temples February 25, 1929. 
Endorses Louis B. Anderson Alderman Tue. February 26, 1929; also, Oscar Du 
Priest for congressman. And endorsed Louis L. Emerson for Governor of Illinois and

These two Brothers are in power by the PROPHET to investigate business etc. of 
Temples number four in Detroit Michigan, because Lomax-Bey has violated all DIVINE 
LAWS of the PROPHET even before the prophet’s face, FEB. 15, 1929. He claims that the 
Prophet has no more power and the finance from Detroit would be in his charge. He 
would not send any to the Prophet. He Lomax Bey, with a loud voice said “Look at me! I 
will guide you through.” 
This is lawful and living evidence spoken before fifteen hounded (1,500) people 
and the Prophet was also present. “I, THE PROPHET, declare his Office vacant and the 
name of Grand Governor discharged. He can only be a member according to LAW 
because the Moorish Science Temple of America is a DIVINE ORGAINZATION. Each 
Temple is under (the) Supreme Guidance of the Prophet. When man fails after being 
placed Head of the Temple by the Prophet of obeying our Divine laws and Constitution, 
he is a traitor and enemy to the Divine Creed and Un-loyal to the National Government 
U.S.A. to which the government is to make men and women better citizens.” 
EXCERPT FROM ‘THE MOORISH GUIDE’ NEWSPAPER - 1929 A. D.  
‘The Moorish Guide’ enters the field of journalism with “Malice to none and charity 
to all.” It is not our purpose to disregard the Work of other splendid journals; it is not 
our purpose to fail to give due attention and space to all American citizens, individuals, 
and organizations alike, who are working in their chosen fields of endeavor for the 
progress and development of all American citizens and all-American Institutions.  
We hope to cooperate with them in the intensive and grueling battle for universal 
justice. ‘The Moorish Guide’ feels that ‘the greatest weapon’ in the hands of our group 
today in America is our press. The truth will never be told about a disadvantaged 
minority by the general press of any country, whether that minority be racial, political,

us will not be told.  
Many of the beautiful things, many of the hopeful things and events which mark 
the progress of our group, would go unrecorded were it not for papers of our own. Our 
papers are our only hope of shoveling ourselves out from under the avalanche of lies 
that are annually let loose upon us. “A strong free press is the best possible safeguard 
of the liberties in general promotion and defense of the interests of strong, free people.” - Prophet Noble Drew ALI- 
PROPHET DREW ALI MAKES HIS FAMOUS PLEA TO THE NATION PUBLICATION IN THE MOORISH GUIDE MARCH 
17, 1929, 
PROPHET MAKES PLEA TO NATIONS Friday, November 9, 1928 Our Divine and National 
Movement stands for the specific grand principles of Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom and 
Justice, and I The Prophet am applying to all loyal, faithful Moors, members, and the 
American citizens to help me in my great uplifting acts of uplifting fallen humanity 
among the Asiatic race and nation, for I have suffered much and severely in the past 
through misunderstanding of what the movement was dedicated to. It is the Great God 
Allah, alone that guides the destiny of this Divine and National Movement. I know all true 
American citizens are identified by national descent name to answer and apply to the 
free national constitution of this free National Republic of the United States of America. 
That is why I am calling on all true national citizens to help me morally and financially 
in my magnificent work; I am going to help this national government. For without a free 
national name a decent flag of your forefathers, there is not a national divine title of 
the government in which we live. Prophet Noble Dew Ali

The citizens of all free national Governments, according to their National Constitution, 
are all of one family bearing one free National name. Those who fail to recognize the 
free national name of their Constitutional government are classed as undesirable and 
are subject to all inferior names and abuses and mistreatments that the citizens care 
to bestow upon them.  
And it is a sin for any group of people to violate the national Constitutional Laws 
of a free National Government; and cling to the names and principles that delude to 
slavery. I, the Prophet, was prepared by the Great God, Allah to warn my people to 
repent from their sinful ways, and go back to that state of mind to their forefathers’ 
Divine and National Principles- that they will be law abiders and receive their divine 
right as citizens according to the free National Constitution that was prepared for all 
free national beings- they are to claim their own free National name and religion.  
There I but one issue for them to recognize by this Government and of the earth, 
and that comes only through the connection of the Moorish Divine National Movement 
which is incorporated in this government and recognized by all other Nations of the 
World. And through it, they and their children can receive their divine rights, 
unmolested by other citizens.  
That they can cast a free National ballot to the polls under the free National 
Constitution of the United States Government, and not under a “Granted Privilege” as 
has been the existing condition for many generations. You, who doubt whether I the 
Prophet, and my principles are right for the redemption of my people, go to those That 
know the law in City Hall and among the officials in your government and ask them 
under intelligent tone and they will be glad to render you a favorable reply; for they are

glad to see me bring you out of the darkness into light. Money does not make the man; 
it is free national standards and power that make a man and a nation. 
The wealth of all National Governments, gold and silver, commerce, belongs to 
the citizen alone; and without your national citizenship by name and principle, you have 
no true wealth. And I am hereby calling on all true citizens that stand for a National 
Free Government and the enforcement of the Constitution to help me in my great 
missionary work, because I need all support from all true American citizens of the 
United States of America. Help me to save my people, who have fallen from the 
Constitutional laws of this government. 
I am depending on your support to get them back to the Constitutional fold again, 
that they will learn to love-instead of hate and will live according to Love, Truth, Peace, 
Freedom, and Justice, supporting our free National Constitution of the United States of 
America. I love my people, and I desire their Unity and mine back to their own free 
national and Divine Standard, because day by day they have been violating the national 
and Constitutional Laws of their government by claiming names and principles that are 
unconstitutional.  
If Italians, Greeks, English, Chinese, Turks, and Arabians are forced to proclaim 
their free national name and religion before the Constitutional Government of the 
United States of America, it is no more than right that the law should be forced upon 
all American citizens alike. In all other governments, when a man is born and raised 
there and asked his name of national descent and name if he fails to give it, he is 
misused, imprisoned, exiled.  
Any group of people who fail to answer up to the Constitutional Standards of Law 
by name and principle, because to be a citizen of any government you must claim your

National name descent. Because they place their trust upon issue and names that they 
are not a part and partial of, and neither were they formed by their forefathers The 
word “Negro” deludes in Latin language to the word “nigger;” the same the word 
“colored” deludes to anything that is painted, varnished, and dyed. And every nation 
must bear a national descent name of their forefathers, because honoring thy fathers 
and thy mothers, your days will be lengthened upon the earth. These names have never 
been recognized by any true American citizen of this day.  
Through your free National name, you are known and recognized by all nations of 
the earth that are recognized by said National government in which they live. The 14th 
and 15th amendments brought the North and in unity; placing the Southerners, which 
were at that time without power, with the Constitutional Body of Power. And at that 
time, 1865, the free National Constitutional Law that was enforced since 1774 declared 
by the Free National Constitution has never been changed, there is no need for the 
application of the 14th and 15th amendment for the Salvation of our people and citizens.  
So, there is not but one supreme issue for my people to use to redeem that which 
was lost, and that is through the above statement. Then the lion and lamb can lie down 
in yonder hills and neither will be harmed; because Lobe, Truth, Peace, Freedom, and 
Justice will be reigning in this land. In those days the United States will be one of the 
greatest civilized and prosperous governments of the world, but if the above principles 
are not carried out by the citizens and my people in this government, the worst is yet 
to come, because the Great God of the Universe is not pleased with the works that are 
being performed in North America by my people, and this great sin must be removed 
from the land to save it from enormous earthquakes, diseases, etc.  
And I, the prophet, do hereby believe that this administration of the government 
being more wisely prepared by more genius citizens that believe in their free National

Constitution and Laws and through the help of such classes of citizens, I the Prophet, 
truly believe that my people will find the true and dive way of their forefathers, and 
learn to stop serving carnal customs and merely ideas of man, that have never done 
them any good- but has always harmed them.  
So I, the prophet, am hereby calling aloud, with a divine plea, to all true American 
citizens, to help me remove this great sin which has been committed and is being 
practiced by my people in the United States of America; because they know it is not the 
true and divine way, and without understanding they have fallen from the true light into 
utter darkness of sin, and there is not a nation on earth today that will recognize them 
socially, religiously politically, economically, etc., in their present condition of 
endevorment, in which they themselves try to force upon a civilized world.  
They will not reframe from their sinful ways of action and their deeds have 
brought “Jim-Crowism,” segregation and everything that brings harm to a human 
being on earth. And they fought the Southerners for all these great misuses, but I have 
traveled in the South and have examined conditions there, and it is the work of my 
people continuously practicing the things which bring dishonor, disgrace, and

HISTORY DEFINED 
History may be defined in a general way as the record of the life of mankind. It is the 
rise and progress of those famous people whose doings constitute the history of 
civilization. In this, its proper and highest science, history presupposes the nations of 
the world advanced beyond the natural or primitive state and to these belong our Great 
Leader Mohamed directed by our Father God Allah.

Respecting mankind outside of nations there is much interesting and valuable 
knowledge supplied by various sciences. By the aid of these sciences much is known 
regarding mankind’s customs, manners, language, arts, and religions which bring us 
back to our Father Allah and the Moslem religion.

In February 1928 I wrote insurance for the prophet in the year 1928 and as the

HE The (PROPHET) said “There is no salary 
attached to the work, but if you can put up 
with my fair, and if you are willing to 
sacrifice with ME, I will see that your rent 
is paid, I Will see that other expenses are

paid, and that you have a little spending 
change.” 
I agreed. 
RETURNING from a trip around the other temples 
one morning in front of the Home Office, at 
3603 Indian Ave, 
THE PROPHET, Said to Me, I, E. Mealy El, “Bro. 
Mealy, you will study up now on all of My LAWS, 
to prove yourself, Because YOU Will have to 
do what I am doing. 
YOU Will go around to all TEMPLES, and report 
back to Me. So read up on My KORAN, QUESTIONARY, 
CONSTITUTION, try to be Perfect on all 
subjects, so you may act intelligent along all 
Lines of Procedures.” 
20 minutes later, in HIS Office, on the same 
occasion, HE DREW ALI, THE PROPHET, said to 
Me “I find all of them want to sit in MY Seat, 
180 
2754 
But in My absence, THAT is Your STATION. And 
2755 
2756

2770 
when you leave, lock the desk, and put the key 
in your Pocket.” 
“EVERYONE wants to sit there, because there 
is where the MONEY is, But  
I know who I want to sit there; and I know who 
I want to handle my MONEY. 
And if you leave for any length of time, give 
the keys to bro. C. Kirman Bey till your 
return.” 
AND Several weeks before the PROPHET Passed, 
I 
was called to HIS private Chamber, for 
special instruction on the many Ways of Life. 
And it was done in a way one never thinks that 
the PROPHET was GOING to leave this Earth then, 
but you would think HE meant he was going to 
live on in the flesh. 
181 
2771 
MY final instructions came one night, after

being called from HOME by the PROPHET, and 
after reaching HIS HOME, and hearing HIM Speak 
through HIS MIGHTY GOD HEADS, HE then asked 
Me, “If I were with HIM, or if I were with 
them?” 
HE further said “I want to know the truth from 
you today:” “Because I have done too much for 
you, for you to turn your Back on ME: I say I 
Your back on ME.” 
BE too BAD.” 
have done too much for you, for you to TURN 
“And if I thought you would turn ME down, 
after what I have DONE For you, it would.

“THE [1932]14-PAGE 2, E. MEALY EL S.G.S. 
LETTER TO A SHEIK” 
Transcribed 8/31/2021 @11:14PM 
He had nothing to do with the Moorish Science 
Temple anymore and why things to cause trouble 
and confusion, and to lead you off the true 
way. I have received some very unpleasant 
letters even from some of our Governors. But 
Allah, my God is watching all. Be faithful to 
our Prophet. Our Redeemer, Our Leader and 
Allah will bless you. I have no ill will 
against anyone, and I am ready at all times 
14 1932 is an intelligent summation from the original state document in our collection of the facts after the Law suites E. mealy EL S.G.S. had to endure. Five attempts to Koo the nation by 
traders to the Prophet’s Trust.

least. But I do not think anyone has the right 
to put himself in the Prophet’s Place and try 
to …?... to those that the Prophet left to 
look after his business. 
We honored Brother Kirkman with papers of 
the Prophet’s credentials to show him we 
appreciated the services he performed over the 
Prophet’s body while in state. But they were 
not given him to take charge of the Moorish 
Science Temple15. Some think he should be. But 
that is in direct violation of the Prophet’s 
law. And if the Prophet had wanted the brother 
to assume authority of his temples, he would 
have appointed him to that post before he 
passed.  
So be very careful dears Moors, read your 
constitution Questionary and Koran and govern 
15 This is proof that C. Kircman Bey never had true authority to become Moderator & Adviser 
184 
2825 
accordingly. On the back of your Questions16,

you will find the lineup of Officials as is 
order, by the will of the Prophet himself. And 
any other way means a failure for you. I am 
endeavoring to get to this understanding here 
and the betterment of all. And in Honor of our 
Prophet, The Glory of Our God Allah. If you 
represent the Judgment of Drew Ali, and His 
Divine Doctrine, I am perfectly satisfied.  
Let us learn to obey whatever the cost may 
be, and victory is on your side. The Prophet 
told me dear Moslems: “I have put my law in 
your head and my word in your mouth and you 
are to tell them what to do, and they are to 
obey.” He also said; “tell them my law, hold 
up me before them. If you will hold me up 
before them, I will draw all men unto me.” 
16 The statement “On the back of your Questions…” is referring to the KORAN QUESTIONS ‘101’s’ the back where the Officers with the “Authority.”  
185 
 
186 
 
I hope you will read this before your body, 2842 
because I have nothing to hide or to be ashamed 2843 
of, because I know Allah and His Prophet are 2844 
with me. They have proven it in the past, it 2845 
is true at present, and will be in the future. 2846 
 Write to me, let me hear what your opinion 2847 
is. I know no ...?...17 Allah, and Noble Drew 2848 
Ali is his Prophet. 2849

A Moorish American Scholar point of reference: As 
you can see from above state document, Supreme 
Grand Sheik E. Mealy EL explains our form of 
government perfectly, leaving no room for 
doubt, about how the PROPHET NOBLE DREW ALI’s 
government is to be officially constituted and 
run by the Supreme Grand Sheik he left in 
charge of the situation.

Notice: C. Kirman Bey19 the only man sitting arms crossed, in the first row. Was just sat down as 
the so-called supreme grand advisor and moderator in 1930 at said Annual Convention by the 
Supreme Grand Sheik E. Mealy EL, who had all authority to do so and in doing, protected the 
Prophet NOBLE DREW ALI and HIS TEMPLE. And the Faithful. 
CONCLUSION 
As Causes leads to effects, as prophecies 
inform the faithful and elect.  
The 6th Annual Convention of the Moorish 
Science Temple of America Sept. 15-20th 1933 
held at FORESTERS HALL would be the last 
convention of our beloved and honored SUPREME 
GRAND SHEIK and Chairman, E. Mealy EL’s life 
here on the plane of manifest.20 The Shepherd 
of the Holy Prophet NOBLE DREW ALI’s flock; 
his direction was true, perfected in his 
grooming for his special work that echoes 
19 Bra looks real upset... arms crossed, and that dark expression ...priceless in the annals of Moorish American history, LOL right Now. 
20 Moroccan American Oral history: E. Mealy El passed in 1933-34 of poison in the blood stream. His wife at the time was the number one suspect in the case; the investigators were concerned how she moved to 
Georgia where E. Mealy EL’s family had moved him in, and she moved back to Chicago. Moorish investigations found she had relations with associates of the Kirman Bey group.

Character in his statesmanship Moroccan 
princely at its best and will stand as his 
testimony recorded for all time.

declared US inc. in 1933 after reconstruction 
because of what the Prophet NOBLE DREW ALI 
establish in getting of vast estate back with 
all the gold and silver, in 1928 Habana Cuba. 
And the establishment of the Moorish Science 
Temple of America inc. in 1933 after E. Mealy 
EL was assassinated, the same year.

HOLY PROPHECIES AND DIVINE STATEMENTS OF PROPHET 
NOBLE DREW ALI 
APPENDIX 
Peace and Blessing Be Upon our Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali. Out of the hundreds of 
prophecies by the Prophet and Divine statements we have selected a few that pinpoint 
our position in time, in accordance with the prophecies. The Date of this writing, 
4/12/2023. 
“Every word I speak is spirit and you Moors had better take heed.”  
” Noble Prophet Drew Ali 
The last prophet in these days is Noble Drew Ali, who was prepared divinely in due time 
by Allah to redeem men from their sinful ways, and to warn them of the great wrath 
which is sure to come upon the earth…Noble Drew Ali who was prepared and sent to 
this earth by Allah to teach the old time religion and the everlasting gospel to the sons 
of men, that every nation shall and must worship under their own vine and fig tree and 
return to their own and be at one with their Father God-Allah. That the world may here 
and know the truth, that among the descendants of Africa there is still much wisdom 
to be learned in these days for the redemption of the sons of men under Love, Truth, 
Peace, Freedom, and Justice. (Ali, 1927) 
“…The Holy Prophet said, “One day all the property is going back to the government.” 
And let me remind you these prophecies took place between the years, 1913-1929(  
213 
3367 
2015 PD23):

“Through sin and disobedience, every nation has suffered slavery due to the facts 
that they honored not the creed and principle of their forefathers.”24 
1. The Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali told the Moors, “I brought you everything it takes 
to save a nation, now take it and save yourself.” When he said that, the Prophet 
was holding up a Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America and a 
Questionnaire and Divine Constitution and By-Laws. 
2. Sister A. Brown El of Temples 4 and 25 said that the Holy Prophet said, “Some of 
you Moors are going to throw away your name, just for a morsel of bread.” 
3. Brothers don’t mark you Fez, it shows you are free. Be the (Plain) Truth like me, 
you Prophet. The Fez is the infinite Headdress of the African God-Man. Neither he 
nor it can be limited, enslaved, or bound. Marking the fez makes it finite, 
territorial, and binding. 
4. The Holy Prophet said, “I am going to stop the European from thinking and start 
you (The Moors) to thinking for your own good.” 
5. Sister M. Tiggs El of Temple 9 said that the Holy Prophet said, “When the 
Europeans go back to Europe, the climate would go back to what it used to be.” 
(The climate in the United States at one time was a tropical climate before the 
Europeans came here). 
6. Sister M. Tiggs El said that the Holy Prophet told the Moors that before the 
European came here (to United States), that the bananas were large, and the 
grapes were four-in-hand it took two men with hand sticks to carry one bunch of 
grapes. 
23 [Presidential Executive Order11004 Seizure of all housing and finance authorities; authority to establish forced relocation, designate areas that must be abandoned as 'unsafe'. Establishment 
of new locations for population groups, building of new housing on public land. 10998 Seizure of all food supplies and resources, public and private, including farms and equipment.] 
24 [11000] Seizure of all American people for work forces under federal supervision; it allows the government to split up families if they believe that it is necessary.

7. Bro. I. Cook-Bey, G.G. of Illinois said that the Holy Prophet said, “One day the 
Europeans are going to lock the food up in warehouses, put soldiers around them 
to guard them, and you will go anywhere he says to get something to eat.” 
8. Sister A. Brown El of Temples 4 and 25 said that the Holy Prophet said, “One day 
the European is going to let you down. You are going to have to put up a 90-day 
supply of food to last you until your brothers come to your rescue from the East. 
9. Holy Prophet said, “If my principles are carried out (The Principles of Love, Truth, 
Peace, Freedom and Justice), the United States will be the richest and most 
prosperous country on the earth, if not, the worst is yet to come.” 
10. Sister M. Howell-Bey of Temple 19 said that the Holy Prophet said that when the 
Europeans asked him, “Will we be saved this time?” The Holy Prophet said, “If you 
do, it will be through them (He was referring to the Moors). 
11. Sister A. Brown El of Temples 4 and 25 said that the Holy Prophet told the Moors 
that the climate was going to change. The cold weather will be in the South, and 
the warm weather will be in the North. 
12. Bro. E. Thomas El of Temple 43 said that the Holy Prophet said, “Money will be 
burnt in the streets, and we won’t be able to buy much, and when I put my spirit 
in the streets, you won’t be able to sell your car for 25 cents.” 
13. Bro. J. Blakely-Bey, and M. said that the Holy Prophet said that “We are going to 
be taxed to death.” 
14.  The Holy Prophet said, “Woe upon the man that calls himself a Jew.” 
15.  The Holy Prophet said, “One day, you will see a $20.00 bill in the street, and 
would not bend over to pick it up.” 
16.  Bro. G. Cook-Bey, G.S. of Temple One said that the Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali 
said, “One day, you are going to look out into the streets, and the streets are

17.  Sister M. Howell-Bey of Temple 19 said that the Holy Prophet said, “This food here 
is just European poison.” 
18.  Before the bank crash in 1929, Sister A. Brown El of Temples 4 and 25 said that 
the Holy Prophet told the Moors, “If they had any money in the bank, to get it out. 
Some said that the Holy Prophet told the Moors to put their money in the post 
office. Those that obeyed the Holy Prophet saved their money, and those that did 
not lost their money.

MOORISH AMERICAN SCHOLAR HISTORICAL & RELIGIOUS FACTS 
HIGHLIGHTS BRO. FREDERICK TURNER EL GRAND SHEIK. 
Moors in Court Notes on Grand Sheikh Frederick Turner-El: A Moorish-American 
Trailblazer by Patrick D. Bowen 
In February 1934, for instance, when another member of his temple, Sarah Smith-Bey, 
was brought to the Bronx Children’s Court on a complaint that she had not let her 
children attend public school on Fridays since the previous Christmas—Friday is the 
MSTA Sabbath—both Turner-Els and another sheik came to the hearing in her support, 
and Frederick spoke as a religious authority. The judge agreed with the younger 
Turner-El that it was right that Muslims should not have to attend school on their 
Sabbath, and eventually dismissed the complaint.13 Frederick had led his Moors to their 
first religion-based legal victory. E.g., “Consul Comes to Aid of Moor on Gun Charge,” 
Albany Evening News, July 7, 1936, 3; “Fez No Hat and so it May Be Worn in Court,” 
Independent, January 28, 1937, 5; “Sheik Seeks Leniency for Lamont Watson-El,”

Border Cities Star, June 1, 1934, 23. 
While there were many factors influencing the African American appreciation of the 
Moorish and Islamic identities, the Moorish identity was profoundly relevant for this 
project of Drew Ali: Morocco and Moors were understood by the MSTA—and not without 
justification—as being, out of all the black and brown nations, historically the most 
respected by the U.S. in the realms of politics and law. See Favorite facts that the MST 
members repeated were that of Morocco’s early recognition of U.S. independence and 
the exemption of “Moors” from slavery in some states. Indeed, it was not until the 
emergence of Turner-El that the political/legal seeds planted by Drew Ali would truly 
have their florescence. 
Turner-El the younger had begun proving himself a true leader, having already stood 
up for his Moors in courts, rebounded from the That ford Avenue incident, and built 
alliances with non-Moors. He had also begun setting up new temples in several New 
England cities, including Bridgeport and Hartford, Connecticut, and in Boston and 
Springfield,Massachusetts.40 The move to Hartford, was particularly important, as it 
was yet another test of Turner-El’s commitment to using the American legal system.

Conclusion 
Prophets Are Sent from Allah in whatever time He see fit. 
The news of a Prophet of Allah the Great God of the universe, was sent to redeem 
his people from their sinful ways in this modern time sounds obscure as if to say, “in 
our time a prophet hard to believe.”  Even though skepticism may prevail, the fact of 
the matter is, a prophet comes in line with the law of the Holy Quran of Mecca or from 
the religious doctrine of the people sent to. 
We are never too bold to question how Allah sees fit to guide or leave stray a 
people or nation. Confirmation that Allah sends prophets (messengers) to the 
people of that prophet’s nation or people; no matter what era in time and they are 
always the seal of their time. (See Surah 14:4 in the Holy Quran) 4.“We did not send a 
Messager except (to teach) in the language of his (own) people, in order to make 
(things) clear to them. Now Allah leaves straying those whom he pleases and guides 
whom He pleases: and He is Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom.” 
In the language of his own people... this statement is particularly important 
because it implies that prophets are sent to their people speaking the language that 
they (the prophet) grew up with. 
As we see in the Holy Quran of Mecca Surah 14:5-6,9. 
5.“We sent Moses with Our Signs (and the Command)...6. Remember! Moses said to 
his people...”

9.“Has not the story reached you (O people!), of those who (went) before you? – of the people of Noah, and Ad, and Thamud...? ” 
Surah 10:47 To every people an Apostle: (Messager), when their Apostle comes, the 
matter will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged. 
Surah 10:49 “Say: “...To every people is a term appointed: when their term is reached, 
not an hour can they cause delay, nor can they advance (it in anticipation). 
As we can see those who follow the Islamic religion; Allah sends every people or 
nation a Prophet (Messager, Apostle) to lead them right. As is the case with the fallen 
sons and daughters of the Asiatic race of North America etc. who were strip of their 
language, history, their religion, and culture during the times of slavery in North 
America from 1779 until 1865; and believed themselves to be Negros, Latinos, Colored 
People, and African Americans to this very day.

Methodology: Introduction to the subject . ‘KNOW THY SELF’:  Scito te ipsu {Saa-toe-tee-ip-sum] – This phrase is a 
concise and precise translation of “Know Thyself” in [MR] Latin. It follows the imperative mood and uses the verb “scito” 
meaning “know” or “learn.” The reflexive pronoun “te” means “thyself,” conveying the self-reflective aspect of the original 
quote. 
Goals: To Understand: the process of thinking; What ‘Higher & Lower Self’ means. Definition(s). 
CHAPTER ONE:  
HIGHERSELF & LOWERSELF 
The science of the Know Thy Self is the study and understanding of the nature of the self [the Body] and its 
relationship with the consciousness of Man or the Soul of Man [Mind], the psychology of Truth and Falsehood 
strangely mixed. How to better comprehend this relationship to bring the selves into harmony or Peace. 
HKMSTA1 CHAPTER III  
THE DIVINE INSTRUCTIONS 
ELIHU'S LESSONS-THE UNITY OF LIFE 
1. Again Elihu met his pupils in the sacred grove and said: 
2. "No man live unto himself, for every living thing is bound by cords to every other living thing. 
3. Blessed are the pure in heart; for they will love and not demand love in return. 
4. They will not do to other men what they would not have other men do unto them. 
5. There are two self’s; the higher and lower self. 
6. The higher self is human spirit clothed with soul, made in the form of Allah2. 
7. The lower self, the carnal self, the body of desires, is a reflection of higher self, distorted by the murky 
ethers of the flesh. 
8. The lower self is an illusion and will pass away; the higher self is Allah in man and will not pass away. 
9. The higher self is the embodiment of truth; the lower self is truth reversed and so is falsehood manifest. 
10. The higher self is justice, mercy, love and right; the lower self is what the higher self is not. 
1Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America; ecclesiastical and secular laws for Moslems; prepared by the Noble Prophet Drew Ali. 1927AD 
2Translation into English from Arabic: Great God. 
11. The lower self-breeds hatred, slander, lewdness, murder, theft, and everything that harms, the higher self 
is mother of the virtues and the harmonies of life. 
12. The lower self is rich in promises, but poor in blessedness and peace; it offers pleasure, joy and satisfying 
gain; but gives unrest, misery, and death. 
13. It gives men apples that are lovely to the eye and pleasant to the smell; their cores are full of bitterness 
and gall. 
14. If you would ask me what to study, I would say, yourselves and you well have studied them; and then 
would ask me what to study next, I would reply, yourselves. 
15. He who knows well his lower self, knows the illusions of the world, knows of the things that pass away; 
and he who knows his higher self, knows Allah; knows well the things that cannot pass away. 
16. Thrice blessed is the man who has made purity and love his very own; he has been ransomed from the 
perils of the lower self and is himself his higher self. 
17. Men seek salvation from an evil that deems a living monster of the nether world; and they have gods that 
are but demons in dis- guise all powerful, yet full of jealousy and hate and lust. 
18. Whose favors must be bought with costly sacrifice of fruits and of the lives of birds and animals and 
humankind. 
19. And yet these gods possess no ears to hear, no eyes to see, no heart to sympathize, no power to save. 
20. This evil is a myth; these gods are made of air and clothed with the shadow of a thought. 
21. The only devil from which man must be redeemed is self the lower self. If man would find his devil 
he must look within; his name is self. 
22. If man would find his savior he must look within; and when the demon self has been dethroned the 
savior, love, will be exalted to the throne of power. 
23. The David of the light is purity, who slays the strong Goliath of the dark, and seats the savior, love, upon 
the throne." 
In acknowledging self,  the purpose is to reach a state of perfection of self or Peace with self and 
with others and environment and God, bringing about a state of happiness and prosperity or peace of mind 
coexisting in true civilization. Or simply to improve oneself in Love. This is accomplished by acknowledging 
the weakness within our character and having the determination to do something about it. To slay the devil 
and demon self cumbersome personalities. 
We are instructed from Professor Drew Ali3 to look within, if we want to find our savior in life or the 
devil in our life and use the light of Purity to slay any unseemly overpowering obstacle that may come in our 
3Prophet Noble Drew Ali; Angel of the GREAT GOD.

aliveness; is to use the attributes of Love that will purify any carnal4, ungodly, or ignorant behavior in one’s 
functional activities, to reach the exalted Throne of power in life. 
Growing up in this contemporary society most were taught a belief that one’s savior was someone 
outside of themselves or a or thee Devil was outside of themselves; yes there are people who have developed 
lower self-characteristics that we can say that person is the devil or a group of people having those 
attributes and behaviors of the lower-self, can be considered a synagogue of Satan like people. 
Also, a person or people can develop the high attributes of the Higher Self and we consider them god
like, prophetic and hold them in high esteem and honor such benevolence and aspire to achieve such high 
and lofty aims in our life, of an exemplified personality such as theirs5. And becoming a god-like people made 
in His image and likeness. 
This may be easier said than done. Uplifting ourselves out of mental slavery. This is because of the nature 
of the Body (Lower-self); what do I mean? Let’s peel this back layer by layer. 
When the lower self is faced with new information that is contrary to its [your] current belief system and is 
challenged and your behavior under your belief system  is inconsistent and contradictory to the truth of the 
new information; it can trigger an episodic reaction of incomprehensible communication and highly emotional 
irrational behavior; that usually comes out as fear, denial, anger, and  confrontational, inconstancy, 
weakness, misery, lying, feeling awkward, or embarrassment. This is known as Cognitive Dissonance. To 
understand it better; see it like, one rejects new information if it challenges their old beliefs [habits], even 
if those habits and beliefs are detrimental to their living. 
Have you noticed that people often like to stick to consistent habits and routines that are popular or 
culturally accepted to maintain order within their lives within the status quo? These habits may include 
everyday activities like preferring a specific seat during their daily commute or eating meals at consistent 
times; or being raised in a social class order ignorantly conforming to that order because of habits pasted 
down from inherited belief systems. Disturbance to this order can lead to mental unease, which may manifest 
in altered thought processes[alter-ego’s] or beliefs and cause [hyperlink(s)} spatial navigation: episodic 
autonomic nervous reactions6 that can be detrimental to one’s life.  
A means of alleviating this conflict is by adjusting either your actions or Habits, and beliefs with truth, 
to restore consistency within self. Cognitive dissonance can become a fact when individuals mostly move 
4Carnal means relating to the physical and especially sexual appetites that can be considered to be immoral , or worldly feelings and wants of the body. Animal nature and lascivious, 
lustful, libidinous fleshly behavior. 
5E.g. Ali, Mohammed, Jesus, Buddha, and  Confucius [Peace and blessing be upon them]  
6The autonomic nervous system is a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates bodily functions, such as the heart rate, its force of contraction, digestion, respiratory 
rate, pupillary response, urination, and sexual arousal. This system is the primary mechanism in control of the fight-or-flight response.[ also called Going Off, Going-Ham, Flashing, etc.].

off, of here-say and stay only in belief, never moving up to faith which is to know and can never enjoy the 
fullness of fruition. 
You can look at it like a reprograming of your basic operating system or an upgrade. First, we 
must run virus software(s) and get rid of any viruses to our system [our mind]. [ things that are contrary 
to the truth and prosperity, happiness] . 
The number One virus in an individual’s operating system is the virus ‘Carnality’ and its myriad of 
attributes. These attributes lie not in the sexual organs nor your hands, mouth, feet, not in the make up on 
your face, or the masks you wore, not the outward show case to idol for all to applaud. “...If man would find 
his savior, he must look within...”. “...If man would find his devil he must look within; his name is self”. 
Looking within: The seat of the lower-self and the Throne of the Higher-self where the conflict & battle7 
takes place, is in your head- where 95% of individuals problems are. 
In Science it is the Brain. The exact part is the Limbic system seat of the Animal nature. 
7The true Jihad

An important part of this puzzle in reprograming your operating system is the “Basic Operating System” or the BOS. And  
how the BOS became the BOS, is the initial 
input data when     
we were children. (1-11).

especially if that memory was 
established through Trauma! Traumatized memory is the strongest memory. They 
are firmly rooted in the hippocampus. And most individuals suffer from childhood 
trauma. E.g., the lack of a Nuclear Family, an environment riddled with ignorance, 
discrimination and violence, also sexual overstimulation and lack of morality, and 
extreme materialism. And it is these unchecked memories that shape our current 
reality for good or bad, and can cause negative spatial navigation [episodic nervous 
reaction that can ruin relationships],  
with 
first 
energy 
In confronting these memories, that were established through trauma, the 
Lower-self will try to deflected you away from the reality of the trauma, because its 
job is to keep you safe from real danger or imaginary fear; and it will fight with denial 
until the pressure of Truth is applied and it has no were to go, other than acceptance. 
After acceptance, is Reflection, then the process of Upgrading takes place: you willingly 
start to apply the instruction of Truth. SET THE TRUTH TO MEMORY.

CHAPTER TWO: 
KNOW THY ADVERSARY! 
In understanding the lower self, we see its attributes in the following 
descriptions: 
A. The lower self, the carnal self, the body of desires. 
B.  The lower self-breeds hatred, slander, lewdness, murder, theft, and 
everything that harms ...” 
C.  The lower self is rich in promises, but poor in blessedness and peace; it offers 
pleasure, joy and satisfying gain; but gives unrest, misery, and death. 
D.  It gives men apples that are lovely to the eye and pleasant to the smell; their 
cores are full of bitterness and gall. 
These defects of character take form in an individual’s personality as: the SIX  DEADLY 
FOES & the 13-CARNAL SINS 
SIX DEADLY FOES: 
1. Instability,   2. 
Inconstancy, 3 Weakness  4. Insufficiency of Knowledge, 5 
Misery,  6. Irresolution                               
The 13 Carnal SINS of One’s Nature: 
1. Vanity,  2. Lying,  3. Theft,  4. Fear,  5. Selfishness,  6. Hatred.  7. Harm-everything 
that harms,  
8. Greed, 9. Ignorance,  10. Slander,  11. Lewdness,  12. Murder,  13. Jealousy. 
These are the viruses within an individual’s operating system; if at any time you 
have experienced these symptoms, well its okay, to have once experienced a few lesser 
viruses; the problems arise when those viruses infect and multiply and morph into 
6 
more complex issue until the entire body is infected and you have the full manifestation 
of Satan. 
The Software used to eradicate any virous in any operating system used is Love and 
the attributes of Love. What do I mean? Well Love’s first expression is Truth and it’s 
this embodiment of Truth that will eradicate those viruses! The Viruses will put up a 
fight and this is when the Truth and falsehood strangely mixed comes into conflict; 
meaning the habits under a belief system is challenged, to a better way of development. 
When the wise separates from the fool.

CHAPTER FOUR 
THE ART OF ANALYZATION 
God is in the details. 
Conduct an analysis: research that supplies information about the situation. This 
involves: 
A. Competitive Analysis: One must know who the [competition, individual, 
problem or issue] is and what they/it/are/is doing; how they are doing it, 
and why it was/is-being done. 
B. Competitive intelligence is the publicly available information on 
[competition, individual, problem or issue], current and potential; it has 3 
parts:  
C. 1). Defensive intelligence: Information gathered to avoid being caught off 
guard; serves to keep track of moves that deal with the issue, i.e., the legal 
ramifications.  
D. 2). Passive Intelligence: Information obtained for a specific decision. 
E. 3). Offensive Intelligence: Identifies new opportunities. Awareness of all  
current and potential opportunities and risks with the incident. An extensive 
understanding of the nature of the issue, both direct and indirect, to help 
obtain an advantage; complete a review of the person, issue, or incident, as 
well as the primary things in association with it. Familiarity with the 
strengths and weakness of the competition, person, or issue.

CHAPTER FIVE 
PSYCHOLOGY & THE ART OF THINKING 
Psychology: is the science of the mind (Soul) and behavior; the mental or behavioral 
characteristics12 of an individual or group. The study of the mind (Soul) and behavior 
in relation to a particular field of knowledge or activity. 
Thinking: is the actions of the Soul. Understanding and reasoning and willing are its 
actions also. Therefore, Thinking is a process of analyzing the data filtered through 4 
fundamental questions: Why, Who, How, and What, which in turn will give an 
understanding, so your reasoning capabilities has enough wisdom to strengthen your 
willing or choices . 
Thinking is your memories X’s what you are perceiving from your 5  main 
senses: processing through your Brain (Limbic System, etc.) to give you a probability 
of what you are perceiving or processing and what to do with that data, in the NOW or 
FUTURE. Or The Souls Behavioral Characteristics in motion for an activity. 
“Canst thou think to greatly of thy soul? Or can too much be said in its praise? It is the image 
of Him who gave it.” 
“Remember thou its dignity forever; forget not how great a talent is committed to thy charge.” 
“Whatsoever may do good, may also do harm. Beware that thou direct its course to virtue.” 
The end of her sech is truth; her means to discover it are reason and experience. But are not 
these weak, uncertain, and fallacious? How then shall she attain to it? General opinion is no 
proof of truth, for the generalities of men are ignorant. Perception of thyself, the knowledge of 
12 Characteristics are the attributes you developed in your youth. i.e., the 12 Step ladder.

Him who created thee, the sense of worship thou owest unto Him. Are not these plain before 
thy face? And behold! What is there more that man needed to know?13

CHAPTER 7 
RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD 
“The only Savior of the world is Love...” 
When the Right & Left hemisphere is balanced with the God principles you have what is known as a wise mind 
and enlighten being, a Master Mind, where the Holy Breath has made them One, again restoring harmony & 
peace. This state of peace does not happen overnight, although we do have the rest of our lives, every second 
that goes by is an opportunity to upgrade our Minds. The Animatic diagram below is a model of: 
The Spirit Man Attentive to the Soul-the Soul Firmly Grounded in Love-Actuating the Flesh. 
Love language to be memorized: 
Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom, 
I align my will with the Will of 
about this Day! Love flows 
from me, I am the Peace 
myself, I am, I achieve 
positive choices, I Love 
anything! I keep my 
needs in the bounds of 
I radiate happiness! I 
move forward with Hope, 
the 
answer 
to 
any 
I am successful in whatever 
myself!! 
and Justice. I am truthful 
within me, Truth flows 
within self, I know 
my Goals, I make 
myself! I can do 
desires, wants, and 
rightness! I am Free!  
Forgive myself- I 
Faith and Love, I have 
problems that may arise, 
I do!  I am amazing! I Love 
With this type of Knowledge of Self, it is easy to see the Love in others and make healthy choices while getting 
into relationships. The Love language is important for you to understand; [remember if you’re not 
programing your system {Mind] then someone or something else is.]. Should be attended to every morning 
12 
after prayer/meditation. Repeated Seven times, then at noon seven times, then before you go to bed seven 
times for 21 days. 
You have awoken the sleeping giant within, and have risen from a dead state of ignorance, to the 
knowledge of self and have come into the marvelous light, stay in the light of Love, and always fight the 
darkness of hate, especially self-hate. 
Even when it seems the darkest in your life you can now just turn on the Light!

“He hath instituted laws for the government of the world; He hath wonderfully varied them in all beings; 
and each, by his nature conformeth to His will.” 
HKMSTA Ch. XXXV: 10 
As a Moorish American we are instructed to “Know thyself and Allah.” This is “Thee Law” the science of 
Moorish Science also known as the “Knowledge of Self” and/or the ‘path’ or ‘way’ or life. To accomplish 
such a lofty idea is to be on the path, “Islamism” or Peace, the Divine instructions for all Moslems; Peace 
with God, Man, Nature/ones surroundings for a simplified understanding. As a Grand Sheik meaning one 
proficient in the degrees of law to understand the way, so as to further instruct and be of service to ones 
brothers & sisters and others on the path. Thus said it is understood… 
“The way, is life, and life is the path, 
of “Thee Law” “; deeper still, being the very law one comes to manifest. All Law is established in ‘Truth’ 
which is Holy Breath, Aught, Allah (All -La (h) w). Truth is that which changes not.  
In the divine instructions for Man it is understood that “… In all the world there are two things. The one is 
truth, the other is falsehood, and falsehood is that which seems to be.  Now truth is aught and has no cause, 
and yet it is the cause of everything. Falsehood is naught and yet it is the manifest of right. Whatever has 
been made will be unmade; that which begins must end.”

conjoined in him and then they thrive, and naught goes down and man as truth abides.”

Laws for civilized Governments, their Religions, Science, Philosophy are grown out of this ‘Force’ 
of nature and its natural development constituted by a Prophet of Allah, one sent to deliver “Thee Law “and 
appoint those faithful to the truth, (trustee); for the greatest development of its people to their highest 
potential which is the nature of its source, that being Truth. In essence all true and divine laws come from 
Allah and due to the divine nature of Allah the laws from Allah to Man are to guide, to instruct to a perfect 
state of being or being Peace itself. It is the need for civilized man to develop ways and paths to better 
comprehend true Law or the ‘Force’, more comprehensively understood the Will of Allah, and institute 
civilizations that harmonize with that Will. (i.e. Moorish Science Temple of America-Moorish Divine and 
National Movement The Kingdom of Heaven, a religious Body Politic a Divine Nation-state establish 1913 
A.D. by the “Will of Allah” through His Holy and Noble Prophet Drew Ali.(Amen). 
Chapter 1 
In the development of civilization the Will of Allah, [Love/Truth] “
Thee Law”, Is the law of all laws 
the first LAW. Its second expression in the picking order of law is 
Natural Law.3 Natural law is existence as 
it is, being what is, functions as it functions according to the laws which make it what it is. So Natural Law 
is the “given-truth” It is the constancies that make existence able to be what it is at all. The science of 
2Quote by: The Scientist 
3 See (Natural Law is perfectly explained through the Seven principles of Thoth)   1. The Principle of Thought: “All is mind, the Universe is Mental”, and 
even our actions arise from thoughts. What we think we shall become. When we have the right thoughts, the right action will follow.  2. The Principle of 
Correspondence:  “As above, so below; as below, so above”, All things have its equivalent part – physically, mentally, and spiritually – which are in harmony 
with another,  physical, mental, and spiritual are not separated but flows in the same line with different degrees of existence. 3. The Principle of Vibration: 
“Nothing rests, everything moves, everything vibrates.” The Principle of vibration is one of the accepted laws of the modern science which states that all 
of life are vibrations at different frequencies, Higher frequency vibrations are in the realm of the unseen while lower frequency vibrations resides in the 
physical world where our sights can translate the visible light. We either vibrate at a state of harmony or a state of chaos. This is within your control... 4. 
The Principle of Polarity: “Everything is Dual; everything has poles, everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are 
identical in nature, but different in degree’ extremes meet, all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.”  5. The Principle of Rhythm: 
“Everything flows out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to 
the right is the measure of the wring to the left; rhythm compensates.”, There is a rhythm. There is a cycle. What flows in, flows out.  6.   The Principle of 
Gender: “Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all planes; to create, there must be infused 
masculine and feminine force.  7.” The Principle of Cause and Effect: “Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause; everything happens according 
to Law; Chance is but a name for Law not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the Law.” [“…there are no happenstance 
laws governs all events…” HKMSTA: Ch. II].

epistemology teaches us that every age there is a milestone in the journey of the human race, and these 
milestones are developed through governments (the people) in harmony with “”Thee Law”; we call these 
times golden ages. We have science, philosophies and medicine and we apply ‘Thee Law’  to these 
expressions of civilizations and we all presuppose in these expressions that we are discovering and learning 
and being able to apply something that already pre-exists. Natural Law is “given-truth”. 
When “Thee Law” begins to emerge in human consciousness through observation and application 
of Natural Law; thoughts, thinking, words, deeds or Actions in the natural order of evolution you have what 
is the most fundamental of all human law. The most fundamental of all human laws is the law of economics, 
Commercial Law. Commercial Law is the third law, it has to do with human survival, with human interactions 
of any kind, any relationship, buying, selling, trading, or relating in any way. Which gave rise to the fourth 
law,
Moral Law of the family. Definition of moral law. : a general rule of right living; especially : such a rule 
or group of rules conceived as universal and unchanging and as having the sanction of God's will, of 
conscience, of man's moral nature, or of natural justice as revealed to human reason4. 
Next which is over looked in most societies when understing the applications of law in its root 
order, is the 
Law of the Family or the 
Law of Nations or the laws of ones forefathers, the laws of ones vine 
and fig tree which gave rise to the Nations -‘
state’ or Government laws to protect the family member 
against any other people (nation) or another family member. The law of Nations or International law, may 
be defined as the body of rules and principles of action which are binding upon civilized states in their 
relation with one another.5 Another way of seeing this is Nationality is the Order of the day.6 
From this emerges governments 
Common Law, common law emerged in England around the 1100 
AD during the dark ages as the Europeans called it. In reality it was during Moorish rule in the lands of 
Albeon that “Thee Law” was being reviled until their renaissance so as to lead the second half of the Kali 
age until it was over with. Common law was developed to resolve disputes over allodial land boundaries; it 
is the law of the land. Common law gave rise to the jury system and writs and processes which 
monarchy/governments have absorbed into their ruler-ships and regulations and rules made into statutes 
and processes in courts, Common law is valid to the extent that it does not conflict with Commercial law.  
From this we get the Five Echelons Hierarchical System of Law: 
 “Thee Law” or the Will of Allah or the Law of the Force 
 Natural Law

5 The Law of Nations by J. L. Brierly 
6 See Nationality is the Order of The Day Moorish American Scholar 2013; google it. 
PAGE 3 
 Commercial Law 
 Moral Law 
 Law of Nations 
A point of reference needs to be expressed for the Adept Moorish thinker. The five 
hierarchy of Law are in perfect oscillation with the Five highest principles of law in 
Moorish jurisprudence; L.T.P.F.J. 
≥
≥
≥ 
Thus these Five high principles are the Source Code of Law for all civilizations, which desire Peace; 
and can be expressed as a formula: Source Code formula and/or the Justice formula, [L x T p/f=J] ©7. And 
brings deeper meaning to “He (Allah) has instituted law for the government of the world…” HKMSTA 
XXXV: 10. We shall discuss this in detail in Book VII of this Seven Book series.  
Chapter 2 
Commercial Law because of its nature is the key that unlocks the doors; in understing its application and 
processes through state and government laws will give the check mate remedy in law. The principles and 
maxims and precepts of Commercial Law are eternal and unchangeable and unchanging. They are 
expressed in the Koran and Bible and it has remained unchanged for thousands of years and it forms the 
underline foundation for all law and governments in the world, the Law of Nations and everything that 
human civilization is built on. Understanding law at this level by these processes, nothing that is of an 
inferior statue can overturn it or change it or abrogate it or meddle with it. It remains the fundamental 
source of authority and power and functional reality. There are ten (10) essential maxims of truth or 
precepts in commercial law:  
1. The first of these expressed in the Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America Ch. XXXI: 
3 “Cast not an evil eye on the goods of thy neighbor; let whatever is his property be sacred from 
7 First observation of Source Code from the divine principles 
Was conceived between Jan.-May 2014 by Bro. C. Jones Bey GS and styled into 
A formula {L*T p/f=J} ©and its principle concepts; which were inspired through the 
Will of ALLAH, by His Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali. (Amen). 
PAGE 4 
thy touch.” Or the Old Testament of the people of the Book, Exodus 20:15 “Thou shall not steal.” 
Which is in terms of Commercial Law  “
A WORK MAN IS WORTHY OF HIS HIRE”  
2. The second maxim of Commercial Law is “Equality before the Law” or moor precisely 
“ALL ARE 
EQUAL UNDER THE LAW” which can be seen expressed in the HKMSTA Ch. XXXI: 5 “Defame him 
not in his character, bear no false witness against him.” Also in Act. 3 of the DC&By-Laws of the 
MSTA8 “Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom and Justice must be proclaimed and practice by all members 
of the Moorish Science Temple of America. No member is to put in danger or accuse falsely his 
brother or sister on any occasion because Allah is love.” What this means is Commercial Law being 
founded on the unchanging principle of “Thee Law” and Natural Law is binding on everyone which 
naturally creates the moral law enforced by the Nation/Family because it is binding on everyone’s 
family and no one can escape it. 
3. The third maxim of law is “
IN COMMERCE TRUTH IS SOVEREIGN” Truth is Sovereign [{the Law of 
the Force},  we can see this maxim and other maxims expressed in the M.A.P9… “Allah the Father 
of the universe {the highest Sovereign authority}, the Father of Love Truth Peace Freedom and 
Justice {The Source Code of Thee Law for the government of the world, Law of the Family} Allah 
is my Protector my Guide and my Salvation by night and by day [all are equal under the law] 
through His [workman] Holy Prophet Drew Ali. (Amen).” {The Divine and National Principles of the 
Nation-state by the Founder} the MAP is also an affidavit]. … And the Sovereign tells the truth 
(your word is your bond aka Covenants). When one is lost out side of his “vine and fig tree” truth 
is not sovereign in Commerce (commerce meaning essentially, every human action and inter
relationships), and when the Will of Allah is not sovereign there would be no basis for anything. 
No basis for law and order, no basis for accountability, there would be no standards, no capacity 
to resolve anything because it means anything goes, each man for himself and nothing matters 
debased down to survival of the fittest, [money becomes ones god]. So “IN COMMERCE TRUTH IS 
SOVEREIGN” 
4. Fourth maxim of COMMERICAL LAW is “
TRUTH IS EXPRESSED IN THE FORM OF AN AFFIDAVIT “. 
In commerce an affidavit must coexist and underlay and form the foundation and responsibility 
for any commercial transaction whatsoever. There can be no valid commercial transaction without 
someone taking the risk and putting his commercial honor on the line and stated that “this is true 
and correct and certain situation” When one issues an affidavit you have engaged a two edge 
sword: it cuts both ways. This affidavit may be a claim or bill that you send to someone in due form, 
8 DC&By-Laws MSTA : Divine Constitution and By-Laws  
Of the Moorish Science Temple of America, Social Compact  
For Moorish Americans and Moslems 
9Moorish American Prayer 
PAGE 5 
and it must say that they owe you some money or something. Someone has got to take 
responsibility for saying, in fact, that this is a real situation, and this why it’s a real situation.  
a. In commerce if someone sends you a bill or assessment or something of this kind they have 
tabulated the goods or services that they have provided for you with the amount of each 
in a booking ledger. They total it at the bottom, and this is the total amount you owe, this 
called a “True Bill in Commerce”. Unless there is a Commercial Affidavit that is, proper 
commercial paperwork with somebody taking responsibility, there is no valid commercial 
transaction. 
b. When you issue an Affidavit in commerce you get the power of the Affidavit. You also incur 
the liability, because there has to be a real situation, other people might be adversely 
affected by it, they may depend on it and go out and start factories and borrow money 
they may think that they have a true bill and have to send money. Someone now is gaining 
as a result of the Affidavit. 
c. 
Affidavits changes things in ways which would/could affect other people. This means 
whoever issued an affidavit in commerce has a liability for its veracity; and if what you say 
in your affidavit is in fact not true, then those who are adversely affected can come back 
to you with a claim for recourse that is justifiable because you LIED. You have told a 
falsehood as though it were the truth. People have depended on it and then they have lost 
because of your lie. 
5. The Fifth maxim of Commercial Law is: “
AN UNREBUTTED AFFIDAVIT STANDS AS THE TRUTH IN 
COMMERCE” meaning claims are made; if they go unchallenged they emerge as the truth in the 
matter. 
A THOUGHT RE: there is a presumption in commerce that Asiatic people are Negros “BLACK 
PRESONS” a second class citizen which is like saying a stateless person or refugee. An if this is 
affirmed by the Asiatic through his/her words deeds and actions and ignorance of the law, (the Law 
of Family) this is no excuses and if unrebutted (the affidavit- ‘Birth Certificate’ that states such a 
shameful and notorious deficit) then he/she are subject to that status. RE: The Prophet Makes A 
Plea to the Nations Friday Nov. 1928. An Affidavit of Proclamation of Nationality issued by a duly 
qualified and verified; appointed and anointed and consecrated Sheik of the Moorish Science 
Temple of America can rebut such a presumption in law. By you proclaiming your nationality and 
religion and allegiance to the divine and national principles in a public meeting among the political 
community and the declaration is made; such a declaration is the first Affidavit to be used with 
others to repudiate such prima face evidence. 
6. The sixth maxim of Commercial Law is
: “AN UNREBUTTED AFFIDAVIT BECOMES THE JUDGMENT 
IN COMMERCE” meaning there is nothing left to resolve. (see Our Authority back of 101’s)  
PAGE 6 
7. The Seventh maxim of Commercial Law is: “
IN COMMERCE FOR ANY MATTER TO BE RESOLVED IT 
MUST BE EXPRESSED” (The Science of Proclamation: “but this is a new era of time and all men now 
must proclaim their free national name in the government in which you live and the nations of the 
earth…”). This means no one is a mind reader. You have to put your position on the line, you have 
to state what the issue is, to have something resolved.
8. There is an ancient principle in Mosaic Law (Canaanite Law) that whosoever leaves the battle field 
fist loses by default. In commerce; it is that an Affidavit which is unrebutted point for point by 
another Affidavit stands as TRUTH IN COMMERCE because it hasn’t been rebutted which leads to 
the eighth maxim of Commercial Law is: “
HE WHO LEAVES THE BATTLE FIELD FIRST LOSES BY 
DEFAULT”. Governments and all of their laws and processes is to resolve disputes and to resolve 
conflicts between Affidavit of Truth.
9. The ninth maxim of Commercial Law is: “
SACRAFICE IS THE MEASURE OF CREDIBILITY” No 
willingness to sacrifice- no liability, responsibility, authority or measure of convection.
10. The tenth maxim of Commercial Law is: “
A LIEN OR CLAIM CAN BE SATISFIED ONLY THROUGH 
REBUTTLE BY AFFIDAVIT POINT-FOR-POINT, RESOLUTION BY JURY, and /or PAYMENT”.

The affidavit, when properly used, especially when leveraged by your status as a free National citizen, is the 
most powerful instrument available defending, protecting and asserting your, National citizenship rights. For 
this reason, it is incumbent upon you to become practiced in its use and in your ability to recognize its many 
forms. If you are unable to recognize when affidavits are being solicited, you may be the unwittingly dupe of 
other parties attempting to create a binding contract.  At this time a look into the understanding of 
Contracts (Affidavits) and the laws that govern them in today’s commercial world would help one see the 
PAGE 8 
applications that the affidavit is applied in its many forms. Contracts are classed under Business Law 
which is Private Law.
Private Law : is that part of substantive law governing individuals ( Nationals) and legal entities (14th 
Amendment citizens known as persons, i.e. Black people, Latinos, Colored people, African Americans, white 
persons and  corporations) in their relationships with one another. 
Substantive Law: creates defends and regulates legal rights and obligations, thus the rules of Contract Law that 
determines when a binding contract is formed are rules of substantive law. 
Procedural Law: sets forth the rules for enforcing those rights that exist by reason of the substantive law. Thus 
procedural law defends the method by which to obtain a remedy in court. 
Public Law: is that branch of substantive law that deals with the government rights and powers and its 
relationship to individuals or groups. Public law consists of: constitutional law, administrative and criminal law. 
By the signature of your hand at  the legal age to contract 18 years old, or before you became of legal age, 
the signature of your parent or other authority such as a physician, have been signing you into bondage 
since you were born mostly through ignorance. Certificates of Live Birth/ Birth Certificates, applications for 
a driver license, and IRS 1040 form, enrollment forms for school/college,  a voter registration, and every 
single document that this modern commercial system requires others to be bound or obligated by, is, or 
requires and affidavit. A ticket is an affidavit when you have to sign, a marriage license is an 
affidavit/contract. Seeing this with the eye of spirit ones actions deeds, words and thoughts are all an 
affidavit and karma is the rebutted or unrebutted Affidavit in one’s life standing as truth in commerce. … 
Now on with the academic. When signed they represent an oath or Commercial Affidavit executed under 
penalty of perjury, “true, correct and complete”. Affidavits also occur in a court settings where testimony 
(oral) is stated in judicial terms by being sworn to be “the truth [the Will of Allah] the whole truth, and 
nothing but the truth, so help me God.” 
In the light of integrity test yourself to see if you comprehend the supra, by matching the few 
preceding statements to one of the 10 maxims of commercial law. NOTE: this is a Pre-Test 
a) “Of all that is good, sublimity is supreme.” 
b) “To tell a lie is to go against the mind” 
c) “He who fails to assert his rights has none” 
d) “He who does not repel a wrong when he can occasions it” 
e) “He who does deny, admits” 
PAGE 9 
As a point of authority on an Affidavit: no court or judge can overturn or disregard or abrogate somebody’s 
affidavit. The only one who has any right or responsibility or knowledge to rebut your affidavit, is the one 
who is adversely affected by it. Just as no one can know what your truth is it is the affected parties 
responsibility and obligation to issue their own affidavit and to speak on their own behalf. 
Commercial law is pre-judicial it establishes the basis for keeping your matters in the private which 
is non-judicial, or pre-judicial (without prejudice). It is the only foundation by which governments or any 
court system can possibly exist or function. All that courts are ultimately adjudicating and making rules 
about, are the fundamental precepts of Commercial Law. Commercial processes are non-judicial. They are 
summary processes (without a jury). 
In commerce there are two phases; assessment, and collection. The Assessment aspect, is about 
determining who owes who, what, why, how much, and for what reason. The collection aspect is based in 
International commerce that has existed for more than 10,000years. It is based on Jewish (ancient 
Canaanite) Law and the Jewish grace period, which is in unites of three; three days, three weeks, and three 
months. This is why you get 90 day letters from billers.  
Without the Knowledge of self “Know Thy Self and Allah.” Which is the Law of the Family which 
directly ties to your nationality; Asiatics or 14th Amendment citizens, won’t know the rules, nor use them, 
they don’t know what the game is, and they don’t know what to do. They don’t know how to invoke their 
rights, remedies and recourses. Most get lost in the cares of the world, doing everything under the sun 
except the one and only things that is the solution to their overall problems, which is based in law. No one 
is going to tell you what to do or the solution other than your Family a Forefather; one sent from among 
you enlighten to the Knowledge of Self, ordained from the Great God (RE: Holy Koran of Mecca Sura 14:4) 
such a One is Noble Drew Ali, Prophet of Allah. 
What can be done about this? SOLUTION: “ACT 6” of the MSTA-DC&By-Laws is the only solution for all 
Asiatics in the Americas. A Declaration is made from the Authority (Sheik) of the One Temple and/or (District 
Temple of the Nation-State). A Declaration is an Affidavit. 
In its formal expression, An Affidavit is a statement of facts that chronicle the events of a particular 
commercial or legal matter, reduced to writing, and sworn to or affirmed before a person legally authorized 
to administer an oath or affirmation such as a notary. The person making the statement is technically known 
as the affiant or deponent. The affidavit usually contains statements that you can attest to, based on your 
firsthand knowledge, and may also contain statements based on the observations of others if you indicate 
this by adding that the information is based on your ‘information and belief’. 
PAGE 10 
You may sometimes see affidavits titled and referred to as “Affidavit of Truth” or Affidavit of Facts”. 
This is informal and redundant-all affidavits are about the truth and facts. Here are some formal definitions 
and types of affidavits and the definition for declaration since this is used in the definition for affidavits 
from BLK Law 6th edition: 
 


administer such an oath or affirmation. 
Affidavit of defense: An affidavit stating that the defendant has good defense to the plaintiff’s 
action on the merit; e.g. affidavit filed with motion for summary judgment. 
Affidavit of inquiry: By court rule in certain states, substituted service of process may be had on 
absent defendants if it appears by affidavit of plaintiff’s attorney, or other person having 
knowledge of the facts, that defendant cannot after diligent inquiry, be served within the state. 
Affidavit of merits: Ones setting forth that the defendant has a meritorious defense (substantial 
and not technical) and stating the facts constituting the same. See affidavit of defense. 
Affidavit of notice: A sworn statement that affiant gas given proper notice of hearing to other

Marshall or his deputy, he shall make affidavit thereof. 
Affidavit to hold bail: An affidavit required in many cases before the defendant in a civil action 
may be arrested. Such as affidavit must contain a statement, clearly and certainly expressed, by 
someone acquainted with the facts, of an indebtedness from the defendant to the plaintiff, and 
must show a distinct cause of action. 
Declaration: A common-law pleading, the first of pleading on the part of the plaintiff in action at 
law, being a formal and methodical specification of facts and circumstances constituting his cause 
or action. It commonly comprises serval sections or divisions, called: “counts”, and its formal part 
follows each other in this general order: Title, venue, commencement, cause of action, counts 
conclusion. The declaration at common law answers to the “libel” in ecclesiastical and admiralty 
law, the “bill” in equity, the “petition” in civil law, the “complaint” is used in the federal courts 
and in all states that have adopted Rules of Civil Procedure.

Chapter I 
Moorish 
The eptomology of the term Moor has the ancient root MR [vowels are interchangeable the root of a word 
is its continents  ] found in Mauraysh (Moorish) also known as TaMaRian or MaRu and aMaRuKa i.e. the old 
Moorish language of what has come to be known as Egyptian, or Hebrew. 
The scholarship word know as Kemet that has come down to mean black land or Black people land 
is not the true and divine name for ancient Egypt. The ancient hieroglyphic clearly shows that the proper 
term is Ta’MooRi or Ta’MoRi/TaMaRe; MR or Pa-ta-Mera: meaning the ancient land of Egypt11. TaMare, 
land of the Moor is the hidden and true Nationality of the real ancient Egyptians. The word KeMiT is a 
geographical name where the praiseworthy black dirt settled. The root word M-R [an abbreviation for 
Mister, Master, Moor,] comes from the old Moorish language or letters [O.M.L.] …  
Commentary: {A point of authority needs to be addressed before we continue with Bro. Walker
Bey’s academic discourse. MR has a deeper meaning in relationship to Moorish Americans title’s Bey and 
El. M-R as we are gathering from the supra means Moor and vowels are interchangeable creating 
variations in eptomology of Moor such as MR also means Master, Mister, Marcus is actually Moor or 
Moreish etc. Let us look at the synonym of MR/Moor “Master”. Master is equal to Lord, Lord and Master, 
Sovereign, and Ruler. Eptomology of Lords, root meaning in most biblical dictionaries is ‘Baal’. Baal is an 
ancient Canaanite God sometimes referred to as the ‘Storm God’ knowns as Ra, ASR/Osiris, and Murdock 
among other lands. Now Baal is in fact Bey; [Ba’al] is in reality [Ba El], meaning Son of El the [al] was 
drooped but can also be expressed as [IL], or [El]. [Ba’] was transliterated into [Bæ] in old English; [Bæ] 
went into Middle English transliterated into [Bey]. [BaBa] anciently means Father and [Ba] means Son, 
11 See E.A. Willis Budge “An Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary vol. 
1.p.315 & vol. 2 p. 1050 
PAGE 20 
also Babe (Son); [Ba] is where we get [Ra] Son/Sun God. Pronounced [Baaa]- Ra, also Rey. Bey (root B-Y) 
or Bai, meaning Noble Priest or Priest King. When the Moroccan Empire ruled the World (also known 
anciently as Egypt, the Capitol Empire of the Dominion of Africa) all Bailiff were Bey-liffs. The term Bey 
became Bay and Bai 12, Obey. Also, using the Hammer to pound in the truth; recent archaeological, 
biblical, and extra biblical research has led scholars working in the area of the origins of Israelite religion 
to assert rather boldly and confidently that the original god of Israel was in fact the Canaanite deity El. 
The name Israel is not a Yahwistic name. El is the name of the deity invoked in the name Israel, 
which translates: “May El persevere.” This suggests that El was seen as the chief god in the formative 
years of Israel’s religious practices. In fact, the etiological story explaining the origin of the name Israel 
occurs in Genesis 35:9-15, where Jacob obtains this name through the blessing of El Shaddai, which is “El 
of the Mountain.” 
Second, there exist numerous parallels and similarities between descriptions and cultural 
terminology used for El in the Canaanite texts and those used for Yahweh in the biblical sources (see 
below). At some point, it is ascertained, the cultural worship of Yahweh must have absorbed that of El, 
through which means Yahweh assimilated both the imagery and epithets once used of El. 
Finally, there is strong confirmation of this assimilation in the biblical record itself. In the oldest 
literary traditions of the Pentateuch, it is El who regularly appears and not Yahweh, or Yahweh as El! The 
patriarchal narratives identify El as the deity to whom many of the early patriarchal shrines and altars 
were built. For example, we are informed in Genesis 33:20 that Jacob builds an altar in the old cutural  
center of the north, Shechem, and dedicates it to “El, god of Israel” (’el ’elohe yišra’el ). There is no 
ambiguity in the Hebrew here: ’el must be translated as a proper name, El. The textual tradition from 
which this text derives, the Elohist, ultimately remembers a time when El was the patron god of Israel. 
That El was the deity worshiped at Shechem is also attested in Judges 9:46, which speaks of the 
shrine of “El of the covenant.” The god of the shrine at Bethel, which literally translates, “house of El,” is 
additionally El—”I am El of Bethel” (Gen 31:13; cf. 35:7)—and appears to Jacob as El Shaddai (35:11; cf. 
48:3). Jacob has another encounter with El at Penuel, which is so named because Jacob sees El face-to
face (32:31). Moreover, Isaac blesses Jacob through El Shaddai (28:3), and likewise Jacob blesses Joseph 
“by El of your fathers” (49:25). “El who sees” is given as the etymology of Beerlahai-roi in Genesis 16:13. 
And we are informed that Abraham journeys to the old cultural shrine at Beersheba, where he plants and 
worships a tree and calls on the name “El the eternal” and at the same time Yahweh (Gen 21:33). Contrary 
to Genesis 33:20, where the Shechemite El is presented unambiguously as the “god of Israel,” in Genesis 
12 See E.H.D., vol. I, p. 202 and S.O.E.D., P. 137, SB2, SB3. 
PAGE 21 
21:33, El is apparently already assimilated to Yahweh (see below). Finally, Genesis 14:18-22 speaks of “El 
the most high,” of whom the Canaanite Melchizedek is priest at Jerusalem. 
This assimilation between Yahweh and El, or El into Yahweh, is present in much of the Priestly 
material as well. In fact, the Priestly source largely advocates this assimilation. In Genesis 17:1, the 
Priestly writer states that “Yahweh appeared to Abram and said to him: ‘I am El Shaddai.’” And Exodus 
6:2-3, in contradiction to J (#11), has Yahweh assert: “I am Yahweh. And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, 
and to Jacob as El Shaddai, and I was not known to them by the name Yahweh.” Although the verse 
suggests an identification between Yahweh and El “of the mountain,” the verse also subtly recognizes an 
ancient distinction between the god of the patriarchs (El) and the god of the Mosaic era (Yahweh). 
Perhaps it is necessary at this point to ask: Who was El? And why is he even mentioned in the Bible in the 
first place, let alone as the god of Israel in the older literary traditions of Genesis? 
Our knowledge of El predominantly comes from The Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple 
of America, Divinely prepared by the Noble Prophet Drew Ali. Also, there is an  invaluable corpus of tablets  
discovered of our ancient Moorish forefathers in 1929, the year the Holy Prophet ascended out of flesh, 
they found  in the ancient city of Ugarit, a major city-state of the second millennium BC located on the 
northern coast of Syria, modern day Ras Shamra, the Ugaritic tablets they are the best available witness 
to Canaanite religion and religious practices (today known as, The Old time religion [Islamism]13), and “to 
the background from which the religion of Israel emerged, and to the Canaanite beliefs that it shared, 
adopted, compromised with, and sometimes rejected.” The Ugaritic literature depicts El as the sovereign 
deity of the Canaanite pantheon. He is frequently referred to as “Father of the gods,” “the eternal King,” 
and “Creator of all living beings.” El’s other epithets include: “El the Kind, the Compassionate,” “the Bull,” 
“the Ageless One,” and “the Father of Years.” He is depicted as bearded, and residing in a tent or a 
tabernacle, whose throne rests on Cherubim. He is the god of blessings and of covenants. 
Many of these epithets and images later become assimilated to Yahweh. For example, Yahweh 
is often depicted as bearded, as King of the gods, as Compassionate, and as residing in a tent, whose 
throne, like that of El, rests on Cherubim. There are, in addition to this, numerous El epithets in various 
strains of biblical tradition—epithets that through a process of assimilation and adoption later become 
associated with Yahweh. We have already encountered El Shaddai, “El of the Mountain.” Like Yahweh 
who is associated with the mountain of Sinai and later in eschatological traditions with Zion, so too El 
resides on a mountain. Other patriarchal narratives attest the use of El Olam, “El the Eternal” to whom 
13 Article from the Moorish Guide national edition 1928 “Islam is a very simple faith. It requires man to recognize his duties towards God Allah, his 
Creator and his fellow creatures. It teaches the supreme duty of living at peace with ones surrounding. It is preeminently the religion of peace…” 
PAGE 22 
Abraham plants and worships a tree at Beersheba, El Elyon, “El the Most High,” the god of Melchizedek 
(Gen 14:18-24), and El Roi [Rey], “El who sees” (Gen 16:13). 
These various El epithets are associated with different shrines: El Shaddai with Bethel, El the 
Most High, the creator of the heavens and the earth, with Jerusalem, El the Eternal with Beersheba, El 
who sees with Beerlahai-roi, and El the god of Israel with Shechem. Many of these shrines and altars to 
El were established by the patriarchs themselves (e.g., Gen 21:33, 28:18, 33:20, 35:14). It has also been 
suggested that the name Yahweh might have originally been a cultural epithet of El! The etymology of 
Yahweh, yhwh, is still unclear, but one proposal is to see it as the causative imperfect of the Canaanite
Proto-Hebrew verb hwy, “to be.” 
It is probable therefore, as many commentators have contended, that the early Israelites actually 
worshiped El through his epithet ‘Yahweh.’ This process of assimilation is usually presented the other way 
around in the biblical literature: Yahweh is worshiped through the epithets of El: Shaddai, Olam, and 
Elyon. 
Contrary to these biblical traditions that suggest an assimilation between Yahweh and El, there 
are other passages that seem to indicate that Yahweh was a separate and independent deity within El’s 
council. Deuteronomy 32:8-9 is one of those rare biblical passages that seemingly preserves a vestige of 
an earlier period in proto-Israelite religion where El and Yahweh were still depicted as separate deities: 
Yahweh was merely one of the gods of El’s council! This tradition undeniably comes from older Canaanite 
lore. 
When the Most High (’elyôn) gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated humanity, 
he fixed the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of divine beings. For Yahweh’s portion is 
his people, Jacob (Ya’cub) his allotted heritage. 
There are two points to take away from this passage. First, the passage presents an apparently 
older mythic theme that describes when the divine beings, that is each deity in the divine counsel, were 
assigned and allotted their own nation. Israel was the nation that Yahweh received. Second, Yahweh 
received his divine portion, Israel [is-ra-el or Isis Ra El], through an action initiated by the god El, here 
identifiable through his epithet “the Most High.” In other words, the passage depicts two gods: one, the 
Most High (El), is seen as assigning nations to the divine beings or gods (the Hebrew word is elohim, plural 
“gods”) in his council; the other, Yahweh, is depicted as receiving from the first god, the Most High, his 
particular allotment, namely the people of Israel. Similarly, in another older tradition now preserved in 
Numbers 21:29, the god Chemosh is assigned to the people of Moab. 
PAGE 23 
Other biblical passages reaffirm this archaic view of Yahweh as a god in El’s council. Psalm 82:1 
speaks of the “assembly of El,” Psalm 29:1 enjoins “the sons of El” to worship Yahweh, and Psalm 89:6-7 
lists Yahweh among El’s divine council. 
Thus there seems to be ample evidence in the biblical record to support the claim that as Yahweh 
become the supreme national deity of the Israelites, he began to usurp the imagery, epithets, and old 
cultural centers of the god El. This process of assimilation even morphed the linguistic meaning of the 
name El, which later came to mean simply “god,” so that Yahweh was then directly identified as ’el—thus 
Joshua 22:22: “the god of gods is Yahweh” (’el ’elohim yhwh). 
Noteworthy also is the fact that unlike the god Baal [Ba’ El or Bey], there is no polemic in the 
Bible against El, and all the old cultural centers of El, those in Jerusalem, Shechem, and Beersheba, were 
later accredited to Yahweh. Since the large majority of patriarchal narratives that speak of shrines and 
altars to El are found in the northern kingdom, such as Bethel and Shechem, and, on the other hand, many 
biblical texts seem to accredit Yahweh’s origin to the southern Negeb, the current scholarly hypothesis is 
that the worship of El in the north and of Yahweh in the south eventually merged. 14 Dang did we just get 
all that from the root MR, lol wow!  }  
In “Ancient History of the Distinguished Surnames Bey”, by The Historical Research Society in 
Orlando FL, state’s that “These (Bey’s) pioneers became the nucleus of the first parts of 
Mexico…archaeological pieces representing Negro or Negroid (Moor) people have been found, especially 
in archaic or pre-classic sites.”  “How old is the Moorish Flag?  An. It’s over 10,000 years old”.15 In this regard 
the testimony of Nicolas Leon proves on how ancient the Moorish/Moabites presence was in America. In 
fact, he says Black people (Moorish people) were the original people of Mexico…the memories of them in 
the most ancient traditions induce us to believe that the Negro (Moors) were the first inhabitants of Mexico.” 
16 Colonel A. Barghine says that he saw in a collection in Ecuador a statuette of a Negro (Ancient Moabite) 
that is at least 20,000 years old.17 
Commentary: Notice the title Bey and its close relationship with Rey meaning King in Spanish. 
Also El Rey means The King… looking at it through its eptomology El Rey means God King or Priest King 
also Bæ El {Bey} or the Son of El. El=The/Thee,  which=Theo or Theos/Deos meaning GOD. God is El 
another name El was known as, is Ea, were we get Ea-rth from, also Gen-Ea-logy meaning the gens of Ea.

We the People… The phrase “We the people” of the United States is far older than the 
Preamble Clause. In pre-historic America (before the pale face Europeans) a people of Moorish decent 
called Lenape or the people and Lenni Lenape which translates to Grandfather, the Old Ones, Original 
People (Aboriginal, Nationals) and We the people. The Lenape are now called Delaware Indians, but they 
never called themselves that. All other so-called Native Americans referred to the Lenape as the very 
ancient ones with magic [naticoke]. William Penn by his own account written in his own hand said, “The 
natives…they are generally tall, straight, well built, singular proportioned , they tread strong and clever, and 
mostly walk with lofty chin; of complexion Black but by design, (meaning their hue not political as the term

13 zones, 16 national states and numerous tribal-city areas and villages. The Moorish/Moroccan ancient

The history of the Pine Tree as a symbol of New England 
predates the European colonial settlements. In eastern 
Massachusetts, southern New Hampshire and the southern 
corner of Maine, there lived a nomadic tribe of Native 
Americans (moors) known as the Penacook. "Penacook" is an 
Algonquin word meaning "Children of the Pine Tree." The 
Penacook people have been credited with teaching the Pilgrims 
of Plymouth Colony much needed survival skills when the 
colonists were starving to death during the winter of 1621-22

These flags were subject to the cherry tree The Moorish Flag the all red flag with the five pointed star in the 
center which is over 10,000 years old here in the Americas.  The leaders of the United peoples of America 
was the Mohawks which derived from MoR hawks; commentary: we can see this in the term Mo’, Mo’s 
eptomology is derived from Moor or Moorish: hawk representing ‘Hours’ or Adept ones.[Mo’] more (adj.) 
“Old English mara "greater, more, stronger, mightier," used as a comparative of micel "great" (see 
mickle), from Proto-Germanic *maizon- (source also of Old Saxon mera, Old Norse meiri, Old Frisian mara, 
Middle Dutch mere, Old High German mero, German mehr), from PIE *meis- (source also of Avestan mazja 
"greater," Old Irish mor "great," [Moor/Moorish], Welsh mawr "great," Greek -moros "great," Oscan 
mais "more"), from root *me- (3) "big." Sometimes used as an adverb in Old English ("in addition"), but 
Old English generally used related ma "more" as adverb and noun. This became Middle English mo, but 
more in this sense began to predominate in later Middle English.”
21    
The Moroccan Empire strayed away from the Great Law of Peace (Islam)22, warred amongst 
themselves, at the behest of their British Denizens (Black Nobility) kin, reinstituted Slavery of the Caucasian 
people (Irish, etc.) and adopted Christianity, by 1677 A.D. . . . The Moorish Empire was forced into a treaty 
as “Liege Subjects” 
commentary:  [liege (adj.) c. 1300, of lords, "entitled to feudal allegiance and service," 
from Anglo-French lige (late 13c.), Old French lige "liege-lord," From late 14c. Of vassals, "bound to render 
feudal allegiance and service." The dual sense of the adjective reflects the reciprocal relationship it 
describes: protection in exchange for service. Hence, liege-man "a vassal sworn to the service and support 
of a lord, who in turn is obliged to protect him" (mid-14c.).  Liege (n.) late 14c., "vassal of a feudal lord," 
also "a feudal sovereign, a liege-lord," probably from liege (adj.)) or from a noun use of the adjective in 
Old French or Anglo-French. A fully reciprocal relationship, so the adjective could apply to either party. 
Old French distinguished them as lige seignur "liege-lord" and home lige "liege-man."]
With Lord Charles II, which by 1729-1774, the Moroccan Empire was compromised and the fall of 
man was in full swing.
23 However by July 1776 the resurrected Moroccan Moors pronounced to the World 
the Authentic “A Declaration” by the representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress 
Assembled [for further information on free Moors people in pre-Columbian America, see “Strangers In 
Their Mist”, S. & R. McLeRoy and “The Melungeons, Bret & Robyn Kennedy”]. The later 1700’s to the mid 
1800’s saw the demise of the Aboriginal Moors of North America’s Lenape Moroccan Empire that set in 
motion the conditions, which would eventually lead to the establishment of the United States of America

The Moroccan Empire of the United states terminated officially in 1776-77 and by 1779 the Moors 
were enslaved until 1886, their nationality was officially taken away in 1774 and they were labeled Negros, 
black, and colored by slave holders in 1779. [# 85: Name some of the marks that were put upon the MOORS

Africa’s [Moorish] Lost Tribe in Mexico 
this is an assignment 
Commentary: [The existence of Afro-Mexicans (another word of art there is no such people as Afro, 
that’s A HAIR STYLE) was officially affirmed in the 1990s when the Mexican government acknowledged 
Africa as Mexico’s “third root”. But Mexico’s real history shows the African presence in the country going 
back thousands of years. Last year, a bilingual exhibition, The African (Moorish) Presence in México: Yanga 
to the Present, was mounted by the Oakland Museum and the DuSable-[Morise] Museum on both sides of 
the Mexican border – in the US and Mexico itself. It traced how Africans – fewer than 2% of colonial Mexico’s 
(1521-1810) population – significantly enriched Mexican culture through their art, music, language, cuisine, 
24 Koran questions for Moorish Americans 
PAGE 28 
and dance. The African Presence in México invited Mexican-Americans and African-Americans (Moorish 
Americans) to look at their identities in light of their shared histories in Mexico and the United States. The 
Spanish first brought Africans to Mexico in 1519(Moors have been on this continent for 10,000 years) to 
work in the agrarian and silver industries, under often brutal conditions. There were constant slave protests 
and runaways (cimarrónes) who established settlements in the mountains of Orizaba. In January 1609, 
Gasper Yanga, a runaway slave elder, led the cimarrónes (or maroons) to a successful resistance against a 
special army sent by the Spanish Crown to crush their uprising.After several cimarrón victories, the Spanish 
acquiesced to the slaves’ demand for land and freedom. Yanga founded the first free African township in 
the Americas, San Lorenzo de los Negros, near Veracruz. It was renamed in his honour in the 1930s. Slavery 
in Mexico was abolished in 1810 by Jose María Morelos y Pavón, leader of the Mexican War of Independence. 
As a mulatto (Spanish and African), Morelos (meaning Moor) was directly affected by Mexico’s prejudices. 
Racial mixes were seen as undesirable by a society that aspired to purity of race and blood.25
. 
Some authorities believe certain Indians to be of Hebrew (ancient Moabite) origins. They base this belief on 
the fact that the Indians were a very religious people. Also saying the Indians tribes had Old Testament 
legends. They worship One Great Spirit and never idols. 
Their name of their God was ALH or ALA, (Allah) or EL-ha, the Hebrew name for God… their form of 
government was also similar. There are similarities of language … Nahoolla and Unehka, meaning: pale 
(Blake or Black) people or impure animals (Goyhm). These class descriptions describing Europeans as 
unclean animals is an important in the connecting of the European slaves, the “Wight’s or things, to debase 
them, so as to enslave them. (What goes around comes around… “Through sin and disobedience, every 
nation has suffered slavery due to the fact that they honored not the creed and principles of their forefathers.” 
HKMSTA: XLVII: 16.)  
Note on the: “Wight’s”; The "Barbary States Of America" represent the 28th and 29th degrees of 
North latitude, occupying nearly the same parallels as Several States of The Union. Stretching over 700,000 
miles, from the Atlantic to the Rio Grande. This made Virginia, The Carolinas, Mississippi, & Texas, the 
American equivalent to Marocco, Tunis, Tripolitania, and Algeirs. The "Wall of The Barbarian World" was 
also the primary seat of christian slavery, at the slave pits at Salle, Marocco.' The Parallel of 36 degrees by 
30 North Latitude, is also the ley line called the 'Missouri Compromise.'  This meant that the wall of Christian 
Slavery ended west of the Mississippi River. The Moors of Al Maurikanuus (Africa) were the first to 
circumnavigate the world, and erect their kingdoms, along energetic ley lines. This Treatise delves into The 
Barbary Powers and their control over the North western and South Eastern lands of America, and how they

were able to erect the perpetual government, while balancing the enterprise of "Wight Christian slavery; 
slavery of Wights led to the enslavement of Moors/ Turks in America, the first slaves aka the 'Wights of 
Europa.”26 
It is also important to note that Egypt, (Ta’mer-ræ) Atlantis, and Americas predominate population 
was depicted as Copper (Coffee) Complexioned and not really ‘Red’ as the Modern Indians or Native 
Americans is commonly depicted. At this time the term “Indian” should be closely looked at. The term Indian 
is a latter Latin word coming from Hindi or Sindu, meaning dark hued and transferring from the older Latin 
word “Ethiopian”.  [DC&By-Law “Act 6 “… are not negros, colored folks, black people or Ethiopians, because 
these names were given to slaves by slave holders..."] The term Ethiopian means something divided.  Jack 
D. Forbs in his book entitled Africans and Native Americans, p.69 states, “in 1524 the people of Carolina 
coast were said to be of dark color not much unlike the Ethiopians.” The Charlotte Observer in 1690 
reported the presence of Moors and that they are the ancestors of a people erroneously called Melungeons. 
(They called President Abraham Lincoln a Melungeon)  Mr. Forbes also states on p. 64 that “When Africans 
are referred to in the Jesuit letters they are always called NEGRO DA GUINE blacks of Guinea to distinguish
them from NRGRO DA TERRA “blacks of the land America.” And on pages 67 &71 he states “… French noir
[black] and negre [black or dark person] … French More [Moor] as equivalent to Negro from Gunie.” … Thus 
26 WHITE SLAVERY 
As Shameful As Black Slavery 
The Irish in Colonial America were considered 
“Niggers Turned Inside Out” 
“Negro slavery was efficiently established in colonial America because Black slaves were governed, organized and controlled by the structures and 
organization that were first used to enslave and control Whites.  Black slaves were ‘late comers fitted into a system already developed.'” 
(Michael Hoffman, They Were White and They Were Slaves and Ulrich B. Phillips, Life and Labor in the Old South, pp. 25, 26) 
Irish Slave Facts 
The Irish slave trade began when James II sold 30,000 Irish prisoners as slaves to the New World.  His Proclamation of1625 required Irish political prisoners 
be sent overseas and sold to English settlers in the West Indies. 
By the mid-1600s, the Irish were the main slaves sold to Antigua and Montserrat (70% of the total population of Montserrat were Irish slaves at this time). 
From 1641 to 1652, over 500,000 Irish were killed by the English and over 300,000 were sold as slaves. 
Ireland’s population fell from about 1,500,000 to 600,000 in one single decade. 
During the 1650s, over 100,000 Irish children between the ages of 10 and 14 were forcibly taken from their parents and sold as slaves in the West Indies, 
Virginia and New England.  Another52, 000 Irish (mostly women and children) were sold to Barbados and Virginia while 30,000 Irish men were sold to the 
highest bidder. 
In 1656, Oliver Cromwell ordered that 2000 Irish children be taken to Jamaica and sold as slaves to English settlers. 
African slaves were very expensive (50 Sterling), had to be transported long distances and paid for not only in Africa but in the New World.  Irish slaves 
were cheap (no more than 5 Sterling) and most often were either kidnapped from Ireland, prisoners or forcibly removed.  They could be worked to death, 
whipped or branded without it being a crime.  Many, many times they were beat to death and while the death of an Irish slave was a monetary setback, 
it was far cheaper than the death of an expensive African.  Therefore, African slaves were treated much better in Colonial America. 
The importation of Irish slaves continued well into the eighteenth century, long after the importation of African slaves became the norm.  Records state 
that after the 1798 Irish Rebellion, thousands of Irish slaves were sold to both America and Australia. 
Irish slavery didn’t end until Britain decided to end slavery in 1839 and stopped transporting slaves. 
The enactment of 1652 in the British Isles: 
“it may be lawful for two or more justices of the peace within any county, city or town, corporate belonging to the commonwealth to from time to time 
by warrant cause to be apprehended, seized on and detained all and every person or persons that shall be found begging and vagrant.. in any town, 
parish or place to be conveyed into the Port of London, or unto any other port from where such person or persons may be shipped into a foreign colony 
or plantation.” 
The judges of Edinburgh Scotland during the years 1662-1665 ordered the enslavement and shipment to the colonies a large number of rogues and others 
who made life unpleasant for the British upper class. (Register for the Privy Council of Scotland, third series, vol. 1, p 181, vol. 2, p 101). 
White slaves were owned by black-a-Moors and Indians to such an extent in the South that the Virginia Assembly passed a law against the practice! 
“It is enacted that Negro (Black-a-Moor) or Indian though baptized and enjoined their own freedom shall be capable of any such purchase of Christians…” 
Christians meant Whites

Negro is used for Indian and not for someone from Africa … In any case it is clear that many Iberians and 
Italians, whether in Europe or America were comfortable using NEGRO, NEGRL, etc., For Americans.” The 
copper complexioned Negro da terra are classified in Black’s Law Dictionary 4th and 6th edition as “Femme 
Couleur Libre” meaning free (Libre) Colored Nation (femme) or people. Black’s Law 6th edition, p. 618 
“Femme Couleur Libre up to the time of the civil War, this term applied to all persons NOT of the European 
race including Indians. Again the word Indian originally did not mean NATIVE AMERICAN, or American, the 
way it is used to day, however, it did mean ‘Ethiopian”.27  Native American are words of art (see BLK Law 
4th Ed., p.1779) idiomatic: meaning “an accepted phrase or expression having a meaning different from the 
literal”. It was the Lawyers idiomatic Latin developed by the Latimers Moors long ago in order to maintain 
absolute control over all judicial proceedings; and the administrating government continues to use this 
practice to this present day.

Chapter III 
US Legal System History 
U.S. Law is Private Merchant Law, leaving the people as Surety and Debtor on the bankruptcy. 
Law is contract, universally and in the U.S., so we must follow the progression of contractual agreements 
which constitute the underlying U.S. Law. (We cannot address all individual laws and cases or you would 
not have time in a life to review it, even though ignorance of the millions of laws, statutes, codes, etc… is 
no excuse in Private Admiralty Jurisdictions.) 
In basically chronological order, the following progression of contracts, and our interpretation of them 
follows: 
1.    The USA, a corporation of the English Crown, is bankrupt, and has been since at least 1788.  The 
Articles of Confederation states in Article 12: “All bills of credit emitted, monies borrowed, and debts 
contracted by, or under the authority of Congress, before the assembling of the United States, in pursuance 
of the present confederation, shall be deemed as considered a charge against the United States, for 
payment and satisfaction whereof the said United States, and the public faith are hereby solemnly pledged.”  
The “Founding Fathers,” as constitutors, acknowledged and reorganized the debt in the US Constitution 
1787, Article VI, hence “constitution.”  Bankruptcy occurred on January 1, 1788 based on 21 loans that the 
United States of America received from the King of England dating from February 28, 1778 through July 5, 
1782, the repayment of which had been ratified by Congress on January 22, 1783.  The United States Bank, 
created in 1791, was a private bank, with 18,000 of 25,000 shares owned by England. 
2.    
No de jure, constitutional Congress has existed since March 27, 1861 when seven (7) Southern 
States walked out of Congress leaving Congress without a quorum for adjourning and therefore ending sine 
die.  That which is called “Congress” today assembles and acts under the authority of the President acting 
in capacity of being Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces, under emergency war-powers rule, i.e. “law 
of necessity,” (see 12 Stat 319, which has never been repealed and exists in Title 50 USC §§ 212, 213, 215, 
Appendix 16, 26 CFR Chapter 1 § 303.1-6(a), and 31 CFR Chapter 5 § 500.701 Penalties).  
3.    
Since the above-referenced date, March 27, 1861, Americans have been under executive rule via 
presidential executive order under the aforementioned Emergency War Powers, 12 USC 95 a, 
PAGE 33 
 
PAGE 34 
            b. Every “citizen of the United States” is now “legally” established as an “enemy” via the Amendatory 
Act of March 9, 1933, 48 Stat. 1, amending Trading with Enemy Act of October 6, 1917, H.R. 4960, Public 
Law No. 91. 
          4.    December 6th, 1865, the 14th Amendment was proclaimed as ratified (even though it never 
properly was, see below).  The 14th Amendment, (which is private Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Trust Law), 
constitutes a constructive, cestui que trust, a public charitable trust, “PCT,” that was expressly designed to 
bring every corporate franchise artificial person called a “citizen of the United States” into an inseparable 
merging with the government until the two are united (with the power inhering in the government, not the 
people).  A cestui que trust is fundamentally different from a regular trust, which is express in nature and 
consists of a contractual indenture involving three (3) parties: Grantor (Creator or Trustor {Prophet}), 
Trustee, {Sheiks} and Beneficiaries.{Members}  In an express trust,{fee-simple estate} legal ownership is 
transferred by written contract between Grantor and Trustee{Koran, Koran Questions for Moorish 
Americans, DC&By-Laws} in which the Grantor surrenders ownership of property to the legal 
person{Moorish American, Heir}, the Trust, to be managed by the Trustee on behalf of those who are to 
benefit from the arrangement, the Beneficiaries.  A cestui que trust, on the other hand, differs from an 
express trust in several crucial ways: 
            a. It is not formed by express contract, i.e. overt agreement expressed in writing, but by legal 
construction.  
            b. A cestui que trust has no Grantor, but, being a constructive trust created by operation of law, i.e., 
has only co-trustees and co‑beneficiaries.  The co-trustees are the parties with the duties for managing 
property for the “public good,” i.e. for the benefit of those designated as co‑beneficiaries. 
          5.    The Legislative Act of February 21, 1871, Forty-first Congress, Session III, Chapter 62, page 419, 
chartered a Federal company entitled “United States,” a/k/a “US Inc.,” a “Commercial Agency” originally 
designated as “Washington, D.C.,” in accordance with the so-called 14th Amendment, which the record 
indicates was never ratified (see Utah Supreme Court Cases, Dyett v Turner, (1968) 439 P2d 266, 267; State 
v Phillips, (1975) 540 P 2d 936; as well as Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 448, 59 S. Ct. 972; 28 Tulane Law 
Review, 22; 11 South Carolina Law Quarterly 484; Congressional Record, June 13, 1967, pp. 15641-15646).  
A “citizen of the United States” is a civilly dead entity operating as a co-trustee and co-beneficiary of the 
PCT, the constructive, cestui que trust of US Inc. under the 14th Amendment, which upholds the debt of 
the USA and US Inc. in Section 4.  
          6.    In conformity with the above-referenced creation of United States (1871) and the 14th 
Amendment, the Legislature of each State created a limited-liability corporation, chartered in a private, 
military, international, commercial, admiralty/maritime jurisdiction, entitled “STATE OF…” e.g. “STATE OF 
 
PAGE 35 
CALIFORNIA,” as evidenced by, inter alia, the change in the seal and the creation of a new constitution, e.g. 
Constitution of the State of California (1879), concerning which, re California: 
            a.  A general partnership agreement, hereinafter “General Partnership,” exists between the 
California Republic (1849), and STATE OF CALIFORNIA (1879), with STATE OF CALIFORNIA acting as 
governmental controller. 
            b. STATE OF CALIFORNIA now acts as an agent/instrumentality of United States, collecting whole life 
insurance premiums, known as “taxes,” for the International Monetary Fund, based, inter alia, upon the 
Limited Liability Act of 1851 and the bankruptcy of United States of 1933, (see House Joint Resolution 192 
of June 5, 1933; Public Law 73-10; Perry v. U.S. (1935), 294 U.S. 330-381, 79 L Ed 912; 31 USC 5112, 5119). 
          7.    Inasmuch as all law is contract, the contract involved in a constructive trust is an implied contract.  
An implied contract can be ratified by two (2) means: 
            a. Acquiescence by silence, i.e. the “government” asserts its intentions concerning your life, rights, 
and property and you assent, don’t rebut, and compliantly go along with what they claim.  In 1871 the 
Government changed the nature of its contract with the people from law as defined by the original 
Constitution of 1787 that recognizes law (common law), admiralty (on the sea only), and equity (functioning 
by voluntary contract between all participating parties), and began relating to people as if they were 
“citizens of the Unites States” within/under the private, commercial, international, military jurisdiction of 
the new de facto corporation, i.e. US Inc.  They offered people a “new deal,” and almost everyone bought 
it (based on naïve and foolish trust and assuming that everything was OK). 
                 The people were thereby denied access to law and placed on the ship of state of US Inc. where 
the captain’s word is law and no one has any rights.  As Jefferson phrased the matter, “As government 
grows, liberty recedes.” 
            b. You expressly accept “benefits” offered by the government, and thereby finalize the contract by 
deed.  This is similar to finalizing a contract with a restaurant by sitting down at a table, reading a menu, 
and then ordering and consuming a meal.  By your deeds you affirm to the restaurant that you will pay for 
the meal in accordance with the price stated on the menu.  No written contract is signed, but a contract is 
formed nevertheless.  
          8.    By the above two (2) means people give implied assent that they are bound by an alleged contract 
with US Inc. in accordance with the terms and conditions that inhere in being treated as a “citizen of the 
United States” under the 14th Amendment, and are therefore placed into permanent legal status as a 
Debtor and Surety for U.S. Inc..  In such a position, people leave the ground of sovereignty and all capacity 
for asserting their unalienable rights in favor of being presumed as having exercised their sovereignty and 
 
PAGE 36 
free-will autonomy for the purpose of going along with the government’s assertion that they sacrifice 
everything for the “public good,” (i.e. the PCT).  By so doing people lose their standing in law, (i.e. they “die 
a civil death in the law.”)  They are placed in the legal position of mortmain (i.e. as if deceased) and are 
shorn of capacity for asserting their rights, since the presumption is that they have already exercised those 
rights for the purpose of being placed in the position they are in, i.e. property of the government with a lien 
against you and everything your life labor could ever create, including your children.  The private being (the 
real individual) is sacrificed for the good of the public (the imaginary collective). 
          9.   When people die such a civil death (i.e. Black people, African Americans, Latinos etc.) in the law 
they are like ghosts, and thereby incapable of managing their own affairs and enjoying their unalienable 
rights.  Like the estate of a decedent, they are then managed by the executors/administrators of the estate, 
in probate.  Such is the condition of every “citizen of the United States” today in law, managed by the 
government agencies acting as executors/administrators of their estates in bankruptcy, legal incapacity, 
and civil death as assets of the bankrupt US.  The US is property of the private Real Parties of Interest, the 
Creditors in bankruptcy. 
         10.  The 14th Amendment was allegedly established for the purpose of creating a citizenship for the 
liberated blacks (so-called), and other disenfranchised people, who otherwise had no citizenship because 
they could not comply with the requirements for state citizenship. (i.e. Nationality, and Divine Creed{ Also 
they have no state government which comes from  ones nation; in other words ones origins. With no state 
they are in effect stateless persons there is no one there to protect their rights as a human being, etc.)  
What actually happened was that the blacks were taken off of the Southern slave plantations and placed 
into the slave plantation of US Inc., a far worse lot.  The government then gradually absorbed everyone else 
— including state citizens — into the same condition.  
         11.  1871-1913.  Officers of the actual government held office in dual capacity, (i.e. in both USA and 
US Inc. status). 
         12.  1912.  Bonds issued by US Inc. came due but US Inc. did not have the resources for paying their 
creditors (the seven families that founded the Federal Reserve Bank), so US Inc.’s owner (the actual 
government) was required to pay the balance.  The national government was also without sufficient funds 
to meet US Inc.’s obligations, so the creditors settled for all of the assets of both US Inc. and the national 
government instead of foreclosure on and liquidation of the entire country.  By so doing, they expropriated 
the nation — both USA and US Inc.  Sic transit America. (Prophet Drew Ali Redeemed the National 
Government in 1913) 
         13.  1912.  US Inc. forms an agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank (It is important to note that both 
of these entities are private corporations which removes the general allegations of treason or fraud from 
this relationship).  Through this agreement, US Inc. must function in debt, even though they have neither 
funds nor resources for financing their operation. 
14.  1912.  The first corporate only Senators are seated in the next election year by popular vote of the 
US Inc. registered voters.  The original-jurisdiction national Senators of the States did not assume office that 
year and at least one third of the nation’s Senators seats were lawfully and voluntarily vacant. 
15.   February 3rd, 1913.  US Inc. passes its 16th Amendment and Congress orders the Secretary of 
State to enter it as ratified even though the States had not ratified it according to Law.  The Secretary 
complied.  It should be noted that this would not have been lawful if it were a national Constitution 
amendment, however it was perfectly legal within the colorable, de facto corporation.  It should also be 
noted that where the national Constitution already had a 16th Amendment and where the Supreme Court 
says that the new 16th Amendment did not do anything, this corporate Amendment must simply be a space 
filler entered such that US Inc.’s Constitution (1871) would have the same number of Amendments as that 
of the national Constitution (1787). 
16.   
April 8th, 1913.  US Inc. passes its 17th Amendment and Congress orders it to be entered as 
ratified in the exact same manner as they did with US Inc.’s 16th Amendment.  This Amendment changes 
where US Inc.’s Senators are elected.  This Amendment is not even lawfully possible as a national 
Constitution Amendment for several reasons, not the least of which is that the Amendment would have 
required that Congress first pass an Amendment that stated that they had the power to say where Senators 
are elected before they could even deliberate on such a subject matter, after which they would then have 
to have competent ratifications performed on such Amendments in accord with Constitutional limits, not 
as was done with US Inc.’s 16th Amendment. 
17.   December 23, 1913.  The Congress, (late at night with only a small cadre of supporters present), 
passed the Federal Reserve Act, surrendering the creation and management of the nation’s currency into 
the hands of a cartel of private — and mostly foreign — bankers.  Currency is the single most essential and 
critical commodity in the world, embodying more law and principles of commerce than any other.  Since all 
interactions are “commerce,” and the medium of doing business in commerce is currency, money is in a 
very significant sense the measure of all things. 
By abandoning control and management of the money supply, the nation surrendered all capacity for 
claiming sovereignty.  The government lost its independent treasury (one of the requirements in law for 
national sovereignty).  The United States Government became a mere fiefdom, or administrative arm, of 
the bankers, who now owned the store. 
PAGE 37 
Passage of the Federal Reserve Act was a major milestone on the “road to serfdom” that this entire 
progression outlines.  The conspiratorial nature of matters is exemplified in comments by one of the major 
actors in the triumph of the Federal Reserve, Edward Mandell House, who had this to say in a private 
meeting with President Woodrow Wilson: 
“[Very] soon, every American will be required to register their biological property in a national system 
designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient system of pledging.  By such 
methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, which will affect our security as a chargeback 
for our fiat paper currency.  Every American will be forced to register or suffer being able to work and earn 
a living.  They will be our chattel, and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation of 
the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions.  Americans, by unknowingly or unwittingly 
delivering the bills of lading to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent, forever to remain economic slaves 
through taxation, secured by their pledges.  They will be stripped of their rights and given a commercial 
value designed to make us a profit and they will be none the wiser, for not one man in a million could ever 
figure our plans and, if by accident one or two should figure it out, we have in our arsenal plausible 
deniability.  After all, this is the only logical way to fund government, by floating liens and debt to the 
registrants in the form of benefits and privileges.  This will inevitably reap to us huge profits beyond our 
wildest expectations and leave every American a contributor to this fraud which we will call “Social 
Insurance.”  Without realizing it, every American will insure us for any loss we may incur and in this manner, 
every American will unknowingly be our servant, however begrudgingly.  The people will become helpless 
and without any hope for their redemption and, we will employ the high office of the President of our dummy 
corporation to foment this plot against America.” 
18.  1917.  Corporate-only Senators begin participating in all matters with those Senators who still had 
original jurisdiction government capacity, as a result of which all activities of the government were 
performed in corporate capacity only. 
19.  1917.  President Wilson was re-elected by the Electoral College, but only US Inc.’s Senate 
performed the Senate confirmation necessary for seating the national President.  There was no national 
government Senate confirmation; no national seats were seated and all remained vacant. 
Note:  the national President is also the Military’s Commander in Chief, and under the nation’s status of 
being ruled by the private, commercial, martial‑law rule of the Bankers and English Crown, the business 
needs of the nation have remained under US Inc. control since 1871, (i.e. ever since US Inc. was 
incorporated and made operational over such matters). {The Prophet Drew Ali wrote in a letter to 
Sheiks/Members and told them “…this is my government I can declare war or Peace…” 
PAGE 38 
 
PAGE 39 
         20.  1917-1944.  All national government seats are and remain vacant, (until the real National citizens 
take control of their government) and US Inc. continues maintaining the business needs of the government 
under martial-law rule. 
         21.  June 5, 1933.  US Inc. declares bankruptcy under House Joint Resolution, “HJR,” 192. 
         22.  1935.  The Social Security Act is passed. 
         23.  On application, the new Social Security Administration (hereinafter “SSA”) creates a private Trust 
with a trust name that sounds like the name of the applicant except the Trust’s name is spelled with all 
capital letters.  SSA makes the applicant a co-trustee of the namesake Trust, designates the SSA General 
Trust Fund as the Beneficiary of the namesake trust, and assigns the Trust a Social Security General Trust 
Fund Account number regarding the applicant for accounting and identification purposes. 
         24.  1938.  In Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 1938, 304 U.S. 64-92, the U.S. Supreme Court sets the 
presumption re the status and capacity of an individual as that of General Capacity/General Partnership 
relationship with the namesake Trust, as if the two (2) entities — individual and namesake Trust — were 
one-in-the-same person.  
         25.  1944.  In the Bretton Woods Agreement, US Inc. is quit-claimed into the newly formed 
International Monetary Fund (hereinafter “IMF”) in exchange for the power allowing US Inc.’s President the 
right of naming (seating and controlling) the governors and general managers of the International Monetary 
Fund, The World Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Inter-American Bank also formed in 
that agreement (codified at United States Code Title 22 § 286).  It must be noted that this Act created an 
unlawful conflict of interest between US Inc. (with its new foreign owner) and its purpose of carrying out 
the business needs of the national government.  This is the cause of our use of the term “original-jurisdiction” 
government.  With the new foreign owner of US Inc. a conflict of interest is created between the national 
government and US Inc., even though the contracted purpose of US Inc. has not changed on its face. 
         26.  Since 1953 – 1975 at least, MKULTRA (Mind Control, etc.), CIA, and Military are unlawfully engaging 
in human experimentation with and without the knowledge of the subjects.  Military airborne toxins are 
sprayed on large cities without warning for the purpose of studying distribution and effect patterns, and 
other more sinister purposes.  Cite: Joint Hearing before the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, 
95th Congress, 1st Session, and August 3, 1977.  
         27.  1962.  At the National Governor’s Conference in Lexington, Kentucky; US Inc. informs the 
governors (under the guise of “public necessity”) that they must all form, or reform existing, private 
corporations under US Inc. (in their State’s interest), so that the people will not discover what the State 
governments are doing with the people’s money (dabbling in foreign notes, i.e. Federal Reserve Notes 
 
PAGE 40 
(FRNs), bonds, and evidences of debt), which activity is forbidden from State governments by their own 
State Constitutions, which information would likely cause a people’s revolt ending in the State official’s 
being, at worst, killed and at least replaced.  The proposed incorporation deadline was 1968. 
         28.  1970.  By this time, each State revised its Constitution and Statutes and formed private corporate 
entities of the name “STATE OF (X)” (where “(X)” is representative of the common State name), and then 
vacated their original jurisdiction government seats in favor of foreign ownership and control under the 
mandate of US Inc. 
         29.  It appears that this was all done so a General Partnership could be presumed as existing between 
“The State” (of the national Union of States) and “STATE OF (X)”, a private corporation.  Said STATE OF (X), 
as General Partner, then assumes the role of governmental operator/controller.  This scenario is further 
proven by the fact that these corporate entities cannot handle gold and silver coin of the United States of 
America in commercial transactions without violating the Par Value Modifications Act and the Foreign 
Currency Exchange Act. 
         30.  September 5, 1996, U.S. Patent & Trademark Office application number 709471 is filed, consisting 
of a plan for marking the alleged “human property” of US Inc., (i.e. every “citizen of the United States”)  
         31.   April 19th, 1994.  Federal agents attack, burn, and raze the compound, killing approximately 100 
of the members of the sect, without any lawful cause for the action. 
         32.  50 USC 1520 et seq.  Demonstrates that there exists an agenda for using Americans (Sovereign 
and otherwise) as biological test subjects.  This is a fundamental breach of an alleged Constitutional contract. 
         33.   President Clinton pushes for a mandatory Health Care Bill for the purpose of placing the physical 
bodies of all Americans under control of US Inc., with international identification attached, for the purpose 
of tagging the populace, as per the Biblical prophecy of the Mark of the Beast.  The computer that would 
handle the tracking is even identified with the acronym: B.E.A.S.T. 
What the above progression depicts is the systematic growth of the power, scope, and pervasive control of 
Government exercised against the American people by foreign, criminal, and hostile powers. 
This same dreary gestalt constitutes the nature of man’s history on this planet as far back as the eye can 
see.  Civilizations rise, fall, and disappear, replaced by new ones that — based upon being founded on, and 
functioning in accordance with, wrong principles — are foredoomed for extinction, as were all of their 
predecessors and as all future civilizations will be until mankind finally learns and ceases “beating a dead 
horse” by structuring law, commerce, religion, and social organization in general on principles that are 
existentially impossible. 
 
PAGE 41 
 
The above progression has proceeded in America by implementing such strategy as: 
       1.  Relentlessly instilling in people the foundational idea that governments in general are absolutely 
essential in the society of man and that the Government in America is the people’s friend and servant, (i.e. 
a “government of the people, by the people, and for the people.”)   
       2.  Creating governmentally owned corporate franchises, such as a “citizen of the United States” and 
one’s all-capital-letter name, with which people are deceived into identifying.  
       3.  Regarding every citizen of the United States as contractually being: 
              a. A corporate citizen, i.e. a corporate franchise; 
            b. A co-trustee (with duties) and co-beneficiary (with privileges) of the 14th Amendment Public 
Charitable cestui que Trust; 
            c. Pledged as an asset in the bankruptcy of US Inc., and therefore a co-surety for the debts of US Inc.; 
            d. An enemy of the Creditors; 
            e. Chattel property of the Bankers and Power Elite; 
            f. A slave with no capacity for asserting any rights, no standing in law, and no capacity for contracting.  
       4.  Functioning on the presumption that the individual being, with autonomy and free will, knowingly, 
intentionally, and voluntarily contracted into the situation of being united — like heads and tails of a coin 
— with a corporate entity created and owned by the Government. 
As per the established maxim of law, “As a thing is bound, so it is unbound,” the way out of the problem is 
within and through the problem.  This is accomplished by understanding what the problem is, (i.e. its 
structure and character, just as solving the problem of a plugged drain is accomplished by realizing that the 
problem is the plugged drain, whereby the solution consists of unplugging the drain.)  “Know the truth and 
the truth shall make you free.” 
The United States Library of Congress now has between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 books on law.  Any law 
library is a daunting place, possessing row after row of shelves with books full of fine print.  Making 
knowledge of such “law” even more unattainable is not only that what passes for law today perpetually 
changes, altered by every new Court Case/Opinion, Legislative enactment, and all of the ever-changing 
Policies, Rules, and Regulations of Administrative Agencies, but an immense amount of the world’s law 
today (as actually implemented) is unwritten and inaccessible. 
This is not only because Judges operate in General Equity in which the ultimate Arbiter of a matter is the 
“conscience of the court” (i.e. how the judge feels about something that day), but because almost all of the 
world’s law is the private Law Merchant of the Creditors in bankruptcy of the world’s Nations, essentially 
all of which are insolvent and in receivership to the Bankers.  [3] This private Law Merchant is of ancient 
origin, and is implemented today. The end. Thanks brother E. W. Bey

Patron Saint of U.S.A. 
Every nation has a patron saint. Does the members of the family of Nations of the United Nations 
know the patron Saint of the United States? What is his name? The name of the Parton saint is St. Tammany 
whose birth day is celebrated on May 1st [Epiphany Moors] and he was a Lenape Delaware Chief [Moor]. 
The word Tammany is rooted in the words Tami and ancient Moorish tribe and Tam, originally meaning 
“those who tame” or civilize. The European proprietors of the United Colonies of America found themselves 
comfortable and ease in Tammany’s presence while attempting to negotiate an agreement that would 
allow them to become an annexed part of the aboriginals Moorish United States of America’s government 
in the Family of Nations.

Chapter V 
Money is anything which is accepted as a medium of exchange or accounting. Money can be 
classified into the following four forms:  
1. Commodity money 
2. Receipt money 
3. Fiat Money 
4. Fractional money 
Before money existed, people used barter to get what they wanted from others. Barter can be defined as 
a system in which one thing is exchanged for something else of like value. A barter exchange is not monetary 
28 Read the treaty of Tripoli  
PAGE 42 
in nature since each item has value rather than being recognized as a medium of exchange to be used later 
for something else. The items being bartered have intrinsic value. This concept of intrinsic value is key to 
understanding the various forms of money. 
Commodity Money: is the oldest form and has its roots in the barter system. As each ancient society 
(Moorish) evolved, there were always been a few items were more commonly used in barter than other 
commodities.  The is because they had certain characteristic, which made them attractive to almost 
everyone. Eventually, these items were traded in large measure because they represented a storehouse of 
value, which could be exchanged at a later time for something else. At this point, they ceased being barter 
and become money. They had become a medium of exchange. Since the medium of exchange was a 
commodity with intrinsic value, it is called commodity money. Common examples of commodity money 
include ornaments, colored seashells, unusual stones, cattle, sheep, corn, wheat or other foods. Eventually, 
when man learned how to refine metals and craft them into tools, the metals themselves became valuable. 
Initially these metals were traded as commodity money due to their intrinsic value. But they had some 
additional characteristic that made them very desirable as money; it was not perishable, it was portable, 
and it could be precisely measured. Money, in its fundamental form and function needs to a storehouse 
(warehouse; Prophet said we need warehouses) and a measure of value. In this way it’s the measure by 
which all other things of value can be compared. The ability to precisely assay metals impurity and weight 
makes them ideally suited for this function. Men on every continent and through history have chosen 
metals for the ideal storehouse and measure of value. 
Gold is the one metal that has been selected by centuries of trial and error to represent this 
storehouse and measure of value. Silver has run a close second to gold throughout history. There seems to 
be enough gold in the world to keep its value high enough for useful coinage. Gold is less abundant than 
sliver but more abundant than platinum. It is a commodity in great demand for purposes other than money. 
It is sought for both industry and ornamental purposes, which assures its intrinsic value. The purity and 
weight of gold can be precisely measured. So gold meets each of the equipment’s for money. It is estimated 
that approximately 45% of all there gold mined since the so-called discovery of America is in various vaults 
of many governments.29 It would be reasonable to estimate that 30% can be found in jewelry, ornaments 
and private vaults. Through reason we see that if 75% of the gold found since Mr. Christopher Columbus 
sailed to the Americas with Moorish maps, after the fall of the Moorish Empire at Granada Spain in1492, to 
other parts of their empire; is available that is too rare to serve as money. We would also suggest that the 
amount of gold in the world does not affect its ability to serve as money, it only affects the quantity used 
29 See Money and Man; A survey of monetary experience, Elgin Groseclose, p 259. 
PAGE 43 
to measure any given transaction. Governments could easily mint gold coins in almost any size to create 
smaller value. 
Using gold (or any other metal or precious stones) to serve as money virtually guarantees the 
stability of a commodity money system. This is true because there is a fixed amount of it in existence. When 
the quantity of so-called money expands without a corresponding increase in goods, the effect is a 
reduction in the purchasing power of each monetary unit. In other words the quoted price and the price as 
expressed in terms of monetary units of goods increase. The real price, in terms of its relationships’ to all 
other goods, remains the same.  This is what we call inflation. The price of goods does not go up but rather 
the value of the money goes down. To see this further let’s look at price and wage statistics during the time 
the Prophet Drew Ali founded the Moorish Science Temple of America 1913 AD. The Federal Reserve Act 
was passed, the same year, the average annual wage in European America was $633. The average exchange 
value for gold that year was $20.67 per ounce. This meant the average worker earned the equivalent of 
30.6 ounces of gold per year. In 1990, the average annual wage was $20,468. But the average exchange 
rate for gold had gone up to $386, 90 per ounce. The average worker therefore earned the equivalent of 
50.9 ounces of gold per year. That is an increase in wages as measured in gold of only 73% while the increase 
in dollar was 3,233%. The 73% increase represents less than 1% per year over the period.  
While this has happened there has been a steady increase in purchasing power about 1% per year, 
which has resulted in gradual improvements in the standard of living over the last 100 years.  
RECEIPT MONEY: The development of receipt (paper) money came as a result of necessity. When a man 
accumulated more coins than he required for daily purchases, he needed a safe place to store (warehouse) 
them. Gold smiths filled this need since they usually had vaults to store (warehouse, Hint, hint) there gold 
they used to create or repair jewelry for their customers. /when customers stored their gold coins, they 
were given a receipt that entitled the owner to withdraw their gold at any time. Eventually, it became 
common for owners to endorse his receipt to a third party who, upon presenting the receipt, could 
withdraw the gold. These endorsed receipts are the forerunner to modern checks. The final development 
stage occurred when serval smaller receipts were issued rather than one large one with each imprinted pay 
to bearer upon demand. It became increasingly common for these paper receipts to be used as money of 
account. So you see that receipt as money of account was fully backed up by a commodity (gold or silver 
coins or other metals or precious stones) that had intrinsic value in money of exchange. 
FIAT MONEY:  fiat money is money which is declared legal tender but is not backed up by anything, such as 
gold or silver. Its two characteristics are that it is not back up by anything of intrinsic value and it is decreed 
legal tender. Legal tender: means that the government issues a law requiring everyone to accept the 
PAGE 44 
currency in commerce, [usually under necessity]. Since the money really is worthless, the only way the so
called government can get it accepted is by forcing the people to do so, often under criminal penalties. 
Their own Federal Reserve Noted are fiat money. There is a typical pattern that emerges when fiat money 
is used. The government artificially expands the money supply through the issuance of more fiat currency. 
Thus is followed with legal tender laws to force the acceptance of the fiat money. Next all the gold and 
silver disappears, into private hordes or it is paid to foreign traders who insist on real money of exchange 
for their wares. Often when the inflation is high, the government will have to issue new bill valued at 
multiples of the old bills. This usually leads to discounts and civil disobedience (through barter). The last 
stage of each cycle is rampant inflation and economic chaos.  
FRACTIONAL MONEY: Fractional money came about as a result of people storing their gold coins with gold 
smiths. The gold simits observed that very few of their depositors ever wanted to remove their gold coin s 
at the same time. Withdrawals seldom exceeded 10% to 15% of their stockpiles of precious metals. They 
hated (coveted, HKMSTA: Ch.? Justice) to see all that gold just sitting there and not being used. So, they 
began to lend (steal) some of the gold out by issuing more receipts. It seemed perfectly safe to lend between 
80% or 85% out which meant they would still have reserves to pay any demand for withdrawal. In the 
beginning the gold owners was not even aware that their gold had been loaned. As the owners became 
aware of the practice, the gold smiths began to offer the share the interest they earned on the loans with 
the owners gold. But the entire practice didn’t'’ make any such sense. The gold was not really availed to be 
loaned. The gold was providing the value behind the receipts. One might say that the receipts was a proxy 
for the gold. Since the gold owner and the one who borrowed the gold, both had receipts they both had 
proxies for the same gold. If you give someone your proxy vote at a stock holders meeting, you can’t also 
show up and vote. The same principles applies to the receipts (proxies) for the gold coins. 
So here is how fractional-reserves work. You deposit your gold and get a receipt that you use as money of 
account. The gold smith (banker) issues loans in the amount of 85% of the amount you deposit. The 
borrower is also given receipts for the amount he borrowed. That means there are 85% more receipts than 
there is gold to back it up. Thus the gold smith (banker acting as a banker) created 85% more money of 
account and placed it into circulation through the borrowers. So, at this point the certificates are no longer 
100% backed by gold. So they only represent a fraction of their face value. Thus the receipts become what 
are called fractional money (of account) and the process that created them is called fractional-reserve 
banking. Banks (bankers) are creating money (of account) based on a borrowers promise to pay (the IOU 
[promissory note]). Bankers then crate more money of account by monetizing so-to-speak, the private 
debts of business and individuals based on their future performance (labor) of serving the so-called lone 
(note).  (Prophet said he’s got the gold and the silver.)

State. Nation-State: is a state that self-identifies as deriving its political legitimacy from serving as a sovereign entity for a country  as a sovereign territorial 
unit/the state is a political and geopolitical entity; the nation is a cultural and/or ethnic entity. The term “nation-state” implies that the two geographically 
coincide, and this distinguishes the nation-state from the other types of state. Now consider this…MSTA-MDNM a nation-state; a state of what? Or better 
stated; what country is the MSTA-MDNM serving as a sovereign entity for? Ans: U.S.A. being the National Republic of the United States of America see 
PROPHET MAKES PLEA TO NATION Friday, March 1, 1929 “…free National Republic of the United States of America...”, “…I am going to help this national 
government…”; National Government: BLK 4th edition: The government of a whole nation, as distinguished from that of a local or territorial division of 
the nation, and also as distinguished from that of a league or confederation; a national government is a government of the People of a single state or 
nation, united as a community by what is termed the ‘social compact’, and possessing complete and perfect supremacy over persons and things, so far 
as they can be made the lawful objects of civil government. Social Compact or Social Contract BLK LAW 3rd pocket edition: The express or implied 
agreement between citizens and their government by which individuals agree to surrender certain freedoms in exchange for mutual protections; an 
agreement forming the foundation of a political society. The Moorish Science Temple of America Divine Constitution and By Laws is a Social Compact. The 
way in which a Member/Citizen surrenders certain freedoms to this Divine Nation-State known as the Moorish Science Temple of America Moorish Divine 
and National Movement, is established in Act 3 “Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom and Justice must be proclaimed and practiced by all members of the Moorish 
Science Temple of America…” This announcement officially amongst ones political community at the District Temple (Subordinate Temple etc.) which one 
is a Member thereof is the allegiance agreement to the Nation-State {One Temple}.  
Another important distinction needs to be made: The help the Prophet gave to the national government was legitimacy. Before the Prophet 
Drew Ali’s great work, the United States was not considered to be a nation in the sense of international law and was ruled on by the Supreme Court in 
1794 in the case of Chrisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. (U.S.) 419, 1 L. Ed. 440 (1793). United States the country is a ‘society’ and ‘sovereignty’ but not a “nation” 
under the laws of nations by the supreme courts own admission. Thus we became a true nation under God when the prophet wrapped the Moorish Flag 
around the little Moorish girl and the American Flag around the little Moorish boy at the Convention of 1928. “…I made you a nation within a nation the 
wheel within the wheel…” Prophet Drew Ali. Thus the Moorish Science Temple of America- Divine and National Movement is the National Government of 
the National Republic of the United State of America. 
33 Power: means n. 1. The ability or capacity to perform or act effectively. Political or national strength (resources minerals, precocious metals), the ability 
to do an act. HKMSTA: Ch. 7:14-18 A “Power is a manifest; it is the result of Force; it is but naught; it is illusion, nothing more. Forces changes not, but 
power changes as the ethers change. Force is the will of Allah and is omnipotent, and Power is that will in manifest, directed by the Breath.”  
34 Redeem :BLK Laws 3rd: The act or instance of reclaiming; this act of reclaiming that which was lost is rooted in Act 6 of the Moorish Science Temple of 
Americas Divine Constitution and By-Laws. Redeem is wider in its application than ransom, and means to buy back, regain possession of, or exchange for 
money, goods, etc.: to redeem one's property. To ransom is to redeem a person from captivity by paying a stipulated price, or to redeem from sin by 
sacrifice: to ransom a kidnapped child.  Oxford Dictionary: Archaic: Free (oneself or another) from slavery or captivity by paying a ransom.

Besides the element of autonomy or self-government, that is, the independence of the community as a whole from the interference of any foreign power 
in its affairs or any subjection to such power, it is further necessary to the constitution of a nation that it should be an organized jural society, that is, 
both governing its own members by regular laws, and defining and protecting their rights, and respecting the rights and duties which attach to it as a 
constituent member of the family of nations.

A third prophecy is attributed to Prophet Muhammad himself, and may have formed the basis for 
other prophecies’. It is related that Muhammad was asked about the end of the world and what would happen 
thereafter to his community. Muhammad replied that the world will come to an end when the most perverse 
and worst people appear at a time when a part of his community will still be in an island situated in the extreme 
west which is called Andalusia. The people of his community will be the last of its inhabitants. All calamities will 
befall them because of their neglect of the religious law and their worldliness, neglecting prayers and indulging 
in luxury.  The minors among them do not respect the elderly, nor do the elderly have compassion for the 
minors; injustices and false oaths abound among them; merchants purchase and sell with usury and deceit and 
covet properties. These and other evil things will become manifest, and God will subject them to people worse 
than they. They will be tormented; cruel governors will rule over them; their property will be confiscated for 
no reason; they will be captive and subject to killing and conversion and will worship images and idols; they 
will be obligated to eat bacon, and will endure other oppressions to the point of hopelessness and despair. 
God will punish their sins, but He will also have pity on them and will forgive them when those evils are 
eradicated and when they return to the practice of the religious laws. The cruelty imposed will be so intense 
that the angels will become vexed and will appear before Almighty calling His attention to their plight. It is then 
that God, the Avenger, will send someone to rescue them from their miserable condition. This will take place 
when the New Year falls on a Saturday. God will then send a sign consisting of a cloud of birds; two of which 
will represent the angels Gabriel and Michael. The first cloud of birds will be flowed by other birds of the earth 
to announce the coming of the King of the East and West, who will take Andalusia. The conflict between Islam 
and Christianity will end with a return to the law of the Moors. There will be much cloud in that year, scarcity 
of water, trees bearing extra fruits, and other signs.

JURY DUTY! 
The purpose of this section is to revive, as Jefferson put it, “The Ancient Principles.” It is not 
designed to promote lawlessness or a return to the jungle. The “Ancient Principles” refer to the 
Ten Commandments and the Common Law. The Common Law is, in simple terms, just plain 
common sense and has its roots in the Ten Commandments. 
In 1776 we came out of BONDAGE with FAITH, UNDERSTANDING and COURAGE. Even 
against great odds, and with much bloodshed, we battled our way to achieve LIBERTY. 
LIBERTY is that delicate balance between the force of government and FREEWILL of man. 
LIBERTY brings FREEDOM of choice to work, to trade, to go and live where one wishes; it 
leads to ABUNDANCE. ABUNDANCE, if made an end to itself, will result in 
COMPLACENCY, which leads to APATHY. APATHY is the “let George do it” philosophy. 
This always brings DEPENDENCY. For a period of time, dependents are often not aware they 
are dependent. They delude themselves by thinking that they are still free— 
“We never had it so good.”—“We can still vote, can’t we?” Eventually abundance diminishes 
and DEPENDENCY becomes known by its true nature: 
BONDAGE! 
There are few ways out of bondage. Bloodshed and war often result, but our founding fathers 
learned of a better way. Realizing that a CREATOR is always above and greater than that 
which He creates, they established a three vote system by which an informed citizenry can 
control those acting in the name of the government. To be a good master you must always 
remember the true “pecking order” or chain of command in this nation: 
1. GOD created man . . . 
2. Man (that’s you) created the Constitution . . . 
3. Constitution created government . . . 
4. Government created corporations . .etc. 
The base of power was to remain in WE THE PEOPLE but unfortunately, it was lost to those 
leaders acting in the name of the government, such as politicians, bureaucrats, judges, lawyers, 
etc. 
As a result America began to function like a democracy instead of a REPUBLIC. A democracy 
is dangerous because it is a one-vote system as opposed to a Republic, which is a three-vote 
system: Three votes to check tyranny, not just one. American citizens have not been informed 
of their other two votes. 
Our first vote is at the polls on election-day when we pick those who are to represent us in the 
seats of government. But what can be done if those elected officials just don’t perform as 
promised or expected? Well, the second two votes are the most effective means by which the 
common people of any nation on earth have even had in controlling those appointed to serve 
them in government. 
The second vote comes when you serve on a Grand Jury. Before anyone can be brought to trial 
for a capital or infamous crime by those acting in the name of the government, permission must 
be obtained from people serving on the Grand Jury! The Minneapolis Star and Tribune in 
March 27, 1987, edition noted a purpose of the grand Jury in this way: 
“A Grand Jury’s purpose is to protect the public from an overzealous prosecutor.” 
The third is the most powerful vote: this is when you are acting as a jury member during a 
PAGE 53 
courtroom trial. At this point, “the buck stops” with you! It is in this setting that each JUROR 
has MORE POWER than the President, all of Congress, and all of the judges combined! 
Congress can legislate (make law), the President or some other bureaucrat can make an order or 
issue regulations, and judges may instruct or make a decision, but no JUROR can ever be 
punished for voting “Not Guilty!” Any juror can, with impunity, choose to disregard the 
instructions of any judge or attorney in rendering his vote. If only one JUROR should vote 
“Not Guilty” for any reason, there is no conviction and no punishment at the end of the trial. 
Thus, those acting in the name of government must come before the common man to get 
permission to enforce law. 
YOU ARE ABOVE THE LAW! 
As a JUROR in a trial setting, when it comes to your individual vote of innocent or guilty, you 
are truly answerable to GOD ALMIGHTY. The First Amendment to the Constitution was born 
out of this great concept. However, judges of today refuse to inform JURORS of their 
RIGHTS. THe Minneapolis Star and Tribune in a news paper article appearing in its November 
30, 1984 edition, entitled: “What Judges Don’t Tell Juries” stated: 
“At the time of adoption of the Constitution, the jury’s role as a defense against political 
oppression was unquestioned in American jurisprudence. This nation survived until the 
1850’s, when prosecutions under the Fugitive Slave Act were largely unsuccessful because 
juries refused to convict.” 
“Then judges began to erode the institution of free juries, leading to the absurd compromise that 
is the current state of the law. While our courts uniformly state juries have the power to return 
a verdict of not guilty whatever the facts, they routinely tell jurors the opposite.” 
“Further, the courts will not allow the defendants or their counsel to inform the jurors of their 
true power. A lawyer who made . . . Hamilton’s argument would face professional discipline 
and charges of contempt of court.” 
“By what logic should juries have the power to acquit a defendant but no right to know about 
that power? The court decisions that have suppressed the notion of jury nullification cannot 
resolve this paradox.” 
“More than logic has suffered. As originally conceived, juries were to be made a safety valve 
way to soften the bureaucratic rigidity of the judicial system by introducing the common sense 
of the community. If they are to function effectively as the ‘conscience of the community,’ 
jurors must be told that they have the power and the right to say no to a prosecution in order to 
achieve a greater good. To cut jurors off from this information is to undermine one of our most 
important institutions.” 
“Perhaps the community should educate itself. Then citizens called for jury duty could teach 
the judges a needed lesson in civics.” 
This booklet is designed to bring to your attention one important way our nation’s founders 
provided to insure that you, (not the growing army of politicians, judges, lawyers, and 
bureaucrats) rule this nation. it will focus on the rule of power you possess as a JUROR, how 
you got it, why you have it, and remind you of the basis on which you must decide not only the 
facts placed in evidence but also the validity or applicability of every law, rule, regulation, 
ordinance, or instruction given by any man seated as a judge or attorney when you serve as a 
JUROR. 
One JUROR can stop tyranny with a “NOT GUILTILY VOTE!” He can nullify bad law in any 
case, by “HANGING THE JURY!” 
“I am only one, but I am one. I cannot do everything, but I can do something. What I can do, I 
should do and, with the help of God, I will do!” Everett Hale

JURY RIGHTS 
“The jury has the right to judge both the law as well as the fact in controversy.” John Jay, 1st 
Chief Justice U.S. supreme Court, 1789 
“The jury has the right to determine both the law and the facts.” Samuel Chase, U.S. supreme 
Court Justice, 1796, Signer of the unanimous Declaration 
“The jury has the power to bring a verdict in the teeth of both law and fact.” Oliver Wendell 
PAGE 54 
Holmes, U.S. supreme Court Justice, 1902 
“The law itself is on trial quite as much as the cause which is to be decided.” Harlan F. Stone, 
12th Chief Justice U.S. supreme Court, 1941 
“The pages of history shine on instances of the jury’s exercise of its prerogative to disregard 
instructions of the judge...” U.S. vs. Dougherty, 473 F 2nd 1113, 1139. (1972) 
LAW OF THE LAND 
The general misconception is that any statute passed by legislators bearing the appearance of 
law constitutes the law of the land. The U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and 
any statute, to be valid, must be in agreement. It is impossible for a law, which violates the 
Constitution to be valid. This is succinctly stated as follows: 
“All laws which are repugnant to the Constitution are null and void.” Marbury vs. Madison, 5 
US (2 Cranch) 137, 174, 176, (1803) 
“When rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or 
legislation which would abrogate them.” Miranda vs. Arizona, 384 US 436 p. 491. 
“An unconstitutional act is not law; it confers no rights; it imposes no duties; affords no 
protection; it creates no office; it is in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never 
been passed.” Norton vs. Shelby County 118 US 425 p. 442 
“The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and name of law, is 
in reality no law, but is wholly void, and ineffective for any purpose; since unconstitutionality 
dates from the time of its enactment, and not merely from the date of the decision so branding 
it. 
“No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are bound to enforce it.” 16 
Am Jur 2nd, Sec 177 late 2d, Sec 256 
INALIENABLE, [UNALIENABLE] OR NATURAL RIGHTS! 
NATURAL RIGHTS ARE THOSE RIGHTS such as life (from conception), LIBERTY and the 
PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS e.g. FREEDOM of RELIGION, SPEECH, LEARNING, TRAVEL, 
SELF-DEFENSE, ETC. Hence laws and statutes, which violate NATURAL RIGHTS, though they 
may have the color of law, are not law but impostors! The U.S. Constitution was written to protect 
these NATURAL RIGHTS from being tampered with by legislators. * Further, our forefathers also 
wisely knew that the U.S. Constitution would be utterly worthless to restrain government 
legislators unless it was clearly understood that the people had the right to compel the government 
to keep within the Constitutional limits. 
*Lysander Spooner wrote as follows: 
“Government is established for the protection of the weak against the strong. This is the principal, 
if not the sole motive for the establishment of all legitimate government. It is only the weaker party 
that loses their liberties, when a government becomes oppressive. The stronger party, in all 
governments are free by virtue of their superior strength. They never oppress themselves. 
Legislation is the work of the stronger party; and if, in addition to the sole power of legislation, 
they have the sole power of determining what legislation shall be enforced, they have all power in 
their hands, and the weaker party are the subjects of an absolute government. Unless the weaker 
party have veto, they have no power whatever in the government . . . no liberties . . . The trial by 
jury is the only institution that gives the weaker party any veto upon the power of the stronger. 
Consequently it is the only institution that gives them any effective voice in the government, or any 
guaranty against oppression. 
ESSAY on the TRIAL by Jury 
JURY TAMPERING? 
A JURY’s Rights, Powers and Duties: 
The Charge to the JURY in the First JURY Trial before the supreme* Court of the U.S. 
Illustrates the TRUE POWER OF THE JURY. In the February term of 1794, the supreme 
Court conducted a JURY trial and said “. . . it is presumed, that the juries are the best judges of 
facts; it is, on the other hand, presumed that the courts are the best judges of law. But still both 
objects are within our power of decision.” 
“You have a right to take upon yourselves to judge of both, and to determine the law as well as 
PAGE 55 
the fact in controversy.” -(State of Georgia vs. Brailsford, et al, 3 Dall. 1) 
“The JURY has an unreviewable and irreversible power . . . to acquit in disregard of the 
instructions on the law given by the trial judge . . .” (emphasis added) U.S. vs. Dougherty, 473 
F 2nd 1113, 1139 (1972) 
Hence, JURY disregard of the limited and generally conviction-oriented evidence presented for 
its consideration, and JURY disregard for what the trial judge wants them to believe is the 
controlling law in particular case (sometimes referred to as “JURY lawlessness”)* is not 
something to be scrupulously avoided, but rather encouraged. Witness the following quotation 
from the eminent legal authority above-mentioned: “Jury lawlessness is the greatest corrective 
of law in its actual administration. The will of the state at large imposed on a reluctant 
community, the will of a majority imposed on a vigorous and determined minority, find the 
same obstacle in the local JURY that formerly confronted kings and ministers.” (emphasis 
added) (Dougherty cited above, note 32 at 1130) 
*Supreme is not capitalized in the Constitution, however Behavior is. 
*Jury lawlessness means willingness to nullify bad law. 
The Right of the JURY to be Told of Its Power 
Almost every JURY in the land is falsely instructed by the judge when it is told it must accept 
as the law that which is given to them by the court, and that the JURY can decide only the facts 
of the case. This is to destroy the purpose of a Common Law JURY, and to permit the 
imposition of tyranny upon a people. 
“There is nothing more terrifying than ignorance in action.” Goethe (engraved on a plaque at 
the Naval War College) 
“To embarrass justice by a multiplicity of laws, or to hazard it by confidence in judges, are the 
opposite rocks on which all civil instructions have been wrecked.” Johnson (engraved in 
Minnesota State Capitol Outside the Supreme Court Chambers) 
“. . . The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.” II Corinthians 3:6 
“It is error alone which needs the support of government. truth can stand by itself.” Thomas 
Jefferson 
The JURY’S options are by no means limited to the choices presented to it in the courtroom. 
“The jury gets its understanding as to the arrangements in the legal system from more than one 
voice. There is the formal communication from the ‘judge.’ There is informal communication 
from the total culture—literature; current comment, conversation; and, of course, history and 
tradition.” (Dougherty cited above, at 1135) 
LAWS, FACTS AND EVIDENCE! 
Without the power to decide what facts, law and evidence are applicable, JURIES cannot be a 
protection to the accused. If people acting in the name of government are permitted by 
JURORS to dictate any law whatever, they can also unfairly dictate what evidence is admissible 
or inadmissible and thereby prevent the WHOLE TRUTH from being considered. Thus if 
government can manipulate and control both the law and the evidence, the issue of fact 
becomes virtually irrelevant. In reality, true JUSTICE would be denied leaving us with a trial 
by government and not a trial by JURY! 
Heroes are men of glory who are so honored because of some heroic deed. People often out of 
gratitude yield allegiance to them. Honor and allegiance are nice words for power! Power and 
allegiance can only be held rightfully by trust as a result of continued character. 
When people acting in the name of government violate ethics, they break trust with “WE THE 
PEOPLE.” The natural result is for “WE THE PEOPLE” to pull back power (honor and 
allegiance). 
The loss of power creates fear for those losing the power. Fearing loss of power, people acting 
in the name of government often seek to regain or at least hold their power. Hence, to 
legitimize their quest for control, laws and force are often instituted. 
Unchecked power is the foundation of tyranny. It is the JUROR’S duty to use the JURY 
ROOM as a vehicle to stem the tide of oppression and tyranny: 
To prevent bloodshed by peacefully removing power from those who have abused it. The 
JURY is the primary vehicle for peaceful restoration of LIBERTY, POWER AND HONOR TO 
“WE THE PEOPLE!” 
PAGE 56 
YOUR VOTE COUNTS! 
Your vote of NOT Guilty must be respected by all members of the JURY— it is the RIGHT 
and DUTY of a JUROR to Never, Never, Never yield his or her sacred vote—for you are not 
there as a fool, merely to agree with the majority, but as an officer of the court and a qualified 
judge in your own right. Regardless of the pressures or abuse that may be heaped on you by 
any other members of the JURY with whom you may be in good conscience to disagree, you 
can await the reading of the verdict secure in the knowledge you have voted your own 
conscience and convictions—and not those of someone else. 
By what logic do we send our youth to battle tyranny on foreign soil, while we refuse to do so 
in our courts? Did you know that many of the planks of the “Communist Manifesto” are now 
represented by law in the U.S.? How is it possible for Americans to denounce communism and 
practice it simultaneously. 
The JURY judges the Spirit, Motive and Intent of both law and the Accused, whereas the 
prosecutor only represents the letter of the law. 
Therein lies the opportunity for the accomplishment of “LIBERTY and JUSTICE for ALL.” If 
you, and numerous other JURORS throughout the State and nation begin and continue to bring 
in verdicts of NOT GUILTY in such cases where nam-made statute is defective or oppressive, 
these statutes will become as ineffective as if they had never been written. 
“If we love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating 
contest of freedom, go home from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or your arms. Crouch 
down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains set lightly upon you, and may 
posterity forget that ye were our countrymen.” 
JURY OF PEERS 
Our forefathers felt that in order to have JUSTICE, it is obvious that a JURY of “PEERS” must 
be people who actually know the defendant. How else would they be able to judge motive and 
intent? 
“PEERS” of the defendant, like RIGHTS of the JURY have also been severely tarnished. 
Originally, it meant people of “equals in station and rank,” (Black’s 1910), “free-holders of a 
neighborhood,” (Bouvier’s 1886), or “A companion; a fellow; an associate. (Webster’s 1828).

powers! 
ARTICLES—COMMON LAW

Articles I-X were proposed Sept. 25, 1789, ratified Dec. 15, 1791. 
AMENDMENTS—EQUITY LAW 
XI. Restriction of judicial powers, proposed Mar. 5, 1794, adopted Jan. 
8, 1798.

serious doubt as to the legality of this amendment because of the manner of ratification 
which was highly suspect. At least 10 States were held by force of arms until the proper 
authorities agreed to vote for this amendment. An excellent overview of this was written by 
the Utah Supreme Court -- 439 Pacific Reporter 2d Series pp 266-276, and for a more 
detailed account of how the 14th amendment was forced upon the Nation see articles in 11 
S.C. L. Q. 484 and 28 Tul. L. Rev. 22., took effect July 28, 1868.

XVI. Income tax, took effect Feb. 25, 1913, possibly only four states ratified it properly. 
XVII. Direct elections of senators; electors; vacancies in the senate, took effect May 31, 1913. 
This moved us from a complex Republic to a simple Republic much like the style of 
government of the Soviet Union. State rights were lost and we were plunged headlong into 
a democracy of which our forefathers warned was the vilest form of government because it 
always ends in oppression. 
XVIII. Prohibition of liquor traffic, took effect Jan. 29, 1920. 
XIX. Voting for women, took effect Aug. 27, 1920. 
XX. Terms of the president, vice president, senators and representatives; date of assembling of 
congress, vacancies of the president, power of congress in presidential succession, took 
effect Feb. 6, 1933.

1967. 
XXVI. Right to vote at 18, took effect July 5, 1971. 
PAGE 59 
• Took effect is used as there is a great deal of suspicion as to the nature of these 
amendments (common law vs equity), also whether the last 16 amendments are legal, 
how many were ratified correctly, do they create a federal constitution in opposition to 
the original, etc. For further studies a good place to begin is with the article by the Utah 
Supreme Court on the 14th amendment, 439 Pacific Reporter 2d Series, pp 266-276, and 
Senate Doc. 240.

Town Classes, Officers and Districts 7 
Town Classes, Officers and Districts  
Every New Yorker lives either in a city or a town. Some towns have within their boundaries one or more 
villages. Although a village is a separate municipal corporation, many town services are provided for the 
entire area of the town, including the village. Residents look to these governments for local services such 
as public safety, roadways, health, recreation and utilities.  
In New York State, there are 932 towns organized to provide government for those residents living outside 
the borders of cities. At one time, city governments were found in urban areas and town governments in 
rural areas. This is no longer entirely accurate. Clustered around our large- and medium-sized cities are 
heavily populated communities that are not a part of a city, but are integral parts of the towns in which 
they are located. Thus, there are urban towns as well as rural towns. Some towns provide a wide range of 
municipal services while others provide just a few. Populations range from more than 750,000 in the largest 
town in New York to fewer than 50 in the smallest.  
Classification of Towns (Town Law, Section 10)  
There are two classes of towns in New York State – first and second.  
Towns of the first class include:  
All those in Westchester County, and  
PAGE 60 
Those elsewhere having a population of 10,000 or more, except: towns in Broome and Suffolk 
counties; the Town of Potsdam, St. Lawrence County; and the Town of Ulster, Ulster County.  
Towns of the second class include:  
All those in Broome and Suffolk Counties  
Town of Potsdam, St. Lawrence County  
Town of Ulster, Ulster County  
Those with fewer than 10,000, except for towns in Westchester County and all suburban towns. 
8 Information for Town Officials  
A town of the second class, except as indicated above, becomes a town of the first class automatically upon 
a census disclosure that the town has a population of 10,000 or more (Town Law, Section 11(1)). Any one 
of three special sets of circumstances, however, makes it possible, either by action of the town board 
(subject to permissive referendum requirements) or by a proposition at the polls, to convert a town of the 
second class (except for the Town of Potsdam) into a town of the first class (Town Law, Section 12). These 
circumstances are:  
A population of 5,000 or more  
An assessed value of taxable real property in excess of $10 million  
The fact that the town adjoins a city of 300,000 or more people.  
The distinction between the two types of towns grew out of differences in the problems that had 
confronted urban and rural areas. More services may be required in towns in more populated areas. The 
government may need to be more complex and its structure will reflect the demands made upon it.  
Today, however, as various statutory provisions have changed and all towns have home rule powers, there 
is little difference, in practice, between the powers and duties of the two classes of towns.  
Suburban Towns  
A town may become a suburban town if it has a population of 25,000 or more, or, in certain cases, has a 
population of 7,500 or more and is located within 15 miles of a city with a population of at least 100,000. A 
suburban town has certain additional powers that are designed to help it provide needed services. For 
PAGE 61 
example, the supervisor may appoint a director of finance to perform some of the fiscal duties (Town Law, 
Section 52). Also, the town board may create departments and appoint individuals to head those 
departments.  
A public hearing must be held if a town decides to become a suburban town. After the hearing, a resolution 
of the town board, subject to permissive referendum requirements, is all that is necessary for the town to 
become a suburban town. The resolution must provide that the town will become a town of the first class, 
if it is not one already (Town Law, Section 50-a). For additional information, see Article 3-A of the Town Law.  
− Town Board  
The legislative authority of the town rests in the town board, which is the governing board of the town.  
The town board, among other functions, generally fills vacancies in town offices, elective or appointive; 
may select a town attorney and a town engineer; appoints constables or police officers; and provides for 
the hiring of other employees as necessary for the conduct of the town’s business (Town Law, Sections 20 
and 64). Certain highway employees are hired by the highway superintendent, but within appropriations 
authorized by the town board (Highway Law, Section 140 (4)).Chapter 1 - Town Classes, Officers and 
Districts 9  
The town board adopts a budget, fixes the salaries of officers and employees, establishes rules of board 
procedure and designates the official newspaper of the town. Other functions are so numerous that only a 
sample can be given here. The town board may provide for the construction of drainage flood control 
facilities; provide for towers to be built, at the request of the Department of Environmental Conservation, 
to watch for forest fires; buy and install traffic control equipment; provide for feeding deer; provide for 
certain public health services; establish a publicity fund; regulate certain dangerous conditions; sponsor 
band concerts; compromise or settle claims; call special town elections; license certain occupations; provide 
for town improvements; establish fire, fire alarm and fire protection districts; create improvement districts; 
and designate depositories for town moneys. The general powers of the town board are set forth primarily 
in Section 64 and other sections of the Town Law.  
Most of the functions of the town board are set forth in the Town Law. However, some functions are set 
forth in other statutes such as the General Municipal Law, the Highway Law, the Education Law, the 
Agriculture and Markets Law, and the Not-for-Profit Corporation Law. In addition, town boards may adopt 
local laws pursuant to the home rule powers granted by Article 9 of the State Constitution and the Municipal 
Home Rule Law.  
Meetings  
PAGE 62 
Certain budget and organizational meetings are required by law (Town Law, Sections 62, 106, and 109). In 
towns of the first class, the law provides that at least one meeting be held each month; we recommend this 
for all towns. With limited exceptions, the meetings must be held within the town at a location specified by 
resolution of the town board. In a town of the second class, there is no specific statutory requirement for 
the number of town board meetings that must be held. However, the law does provide for certain meetings 
and hearings, such as the hearing on the preliminary budget, an annual accounting day, and others. Beyond 
these requirements, a town board is generally free to establish, by resolution, a time, date and place for 
regular meetings (Town Law, Section 62; Public Officers Law, Article 7).  
Occasionally there will be a need for a special meeting. The supervisor may call a special meeting, and must 
give at least two days’ notice in writing to members of the board as to the place and time of the meeting. 
When two members of the board other than the supervisor request a special meeting in writing, the 
supervisor must, within 10 days of the request, call a special meeting, giving at least two days’ notice in 
writing. The supervisor has no option in this matter (Town Law, Section 62).10 Information for Town 
Officials

(a) The town supervisor serves as budget officer unless he/she appoints someone else (Town Law, Section 
103 (2) ).  
(b) A town may have fewer than four council members under certain circumstances. (Town Law, Sections 
20 (1) (a), (b), 60-a, and 81 (2)(c) ). In a first class town, the number of council members may be increased 
to six, subject to permissive referendum requirements (Town Law, Section 81 (2) (a) ).  
(c) This office is generally appointive.  
(d) A town with an elective highway superintendent may abolish the office of highway superintendent by 
local law, subject to permissive referendum requirements, if the town has a contract in force and effect 
with another municipality for the municipality to provide highway, road and street maintenance and repair 
for a period of at least five years (Town Law, Section 20(1)(k)).  
(e) A town board may determine by resolution, subject to permissive referendum requirements, that the 
number of town justices shall be reduced (Town Law, Section 60-a). A town containing a population in 
excess of 50,000 may, subject to referendum, create the office of a third town justice. Those with a 
population of more than 75,000 may establish the offices of a third and/or fourth justice, subject to 
referendum (Town Law, Section 20 (1) (d) ).  
(f) This may be an elected position. There may be up to three assessors in a second class town that has 
exercised an option contained in former Section 1556 of the Real Property Tax Law(Town Law Section 
20(1)(b), Town Law Section 20(1)(f)).  
(g) In a second class town, the town board may adopt a resolution abolishing the office of tax collector. If 
the board adopts the resolution, the duties of the tax collector will be performed by the town clerk (Town 
Law, Section 36).  
(h) In a second class town, this position may exist only if the population is over 40,000 (Town Law, Section 
20 (3)(b)).  
Note: Not all the listed offices are mandatory and additional offices may exist in individual towns. Chapter 
1 - Town Classes, Officers and Districts 11  
Supervisor  
The town supervisor fills a significant role, serving in several major capacities, including:  
Presiding Officer (Chairperson) – The supervisor is the presiding officer at meetings of the town 
board (Town Law, Section 63).  
PAGE 64 
Town Legislator (Town Board Member) – The supervisor votes on matters before the town board 
as do all the other board members (Town Law, Sections 60 and 63).  
Town Executive and Administrator – After town board decisions have been made, it is the 
supervisor who often carries out the decisions. The supervisor usually receives the majority of complaints 
and suggestions of citizens, as well.  
Town Fiscal Officer – The supervisor is the treasurer of the town and generally represents the town 
in the conduct of its financial affairs. Chapter 2 of this publication discusses many aspects of this very 
important role (Town Law, Section 29).  
Representative of the Town (County Board Member) – The office of supervisor may be a county 
as well as a town post. Depending on the type of county government, a town supervisor may serve on the 
county board as a representative of the town (County Law, Section 150). There are two basic types of 
organizational structures for counties: a separately elected legislature or a board of supervisors. For a 
county with a board of supervisors, the supervisors elected from the several cities and towns in the county 
constitute the board. These supervisors may serve on county board committees and receive compensation 
as members of the county board of supervisors (County Law, Section 200). Currently, 17 counties operate 
under the board of supervisors structure, while the remaining 40 counties outside of New York City operate 
under the legislative structure.  
Deputy Supervisor  
A town board may decide to establish the office of deputy supervisor. If it does, that official is appointed by 
the supervisor or by the town board if the supervisor fails to do so within five days after the establishment 
of the office, or within five days after a vacancy occurs in the office. Any person, including a town officer or 
employee, may be appointed deputy supervisor. If a town officer or employee is appointed deputy 
supervisor, that person may receive extra pay. The deputy supervisor does not sit on the county board and 
has no vote on the town board unless the deputy is also a town board member and entitled to a vote by 
virtue of that office (Town Law, Section 42).  
Town Clerk  
The town clerk is also clerk of the town board but has no vote. The clerk is in charge of most town records, 
issues certain licenses and permits, files reports with county and State agencies as required, is involved with 
election administration, posts legal notices, and is, in many ways, a pivot around which the town operates 
(Town Law, Section 30).12 Information for Town Officials  
PAGE 65 
Town Justice  
Town justices have jurisdiction in criminal and civil matters, and in special proceedings as conferred by law 
(Town Law, Section 31; Uniform Justice Court Act). The Office of the State Comptroller (OSC) provides a 
separate publication for Town Justices entitled Handbook for Town and Village Justices and Court Clerks. 
The handbook, which provides guidance on the reporting and handling of fines, is available online at 
http://www.osc.state.ny.us/localgov/ pubs/jch.pdf.  
Superintendent of Highways  
The town superintendent of highways is primarily responsible for the maintenance and repair of town 
highways and bridges, and the removal of obstructions caused by brush and snow. The Superintendent 
generally has the power to hire, subject to appropriations established by the town board, and direct 
highway department employees for those purposes. The salary and expenses of the superintendent and 
the deputy (if any) and certain other administrative expenses are paid from the general fund. Other highway 
expenses are generally paid from the highway fund (Highway Law, Section 141; Town Law, Section 32).  
Assessor  
The assessor or board of assessors is charged with the responsibility of assessing real property in the town 
for purposes of taxation (Town Law Section 33, Real Property Tax Law Section 102(3), see generally, Real 
Property Tax Law Article 5, Title 1).  
Board of Assessment  
A board of assessment review hears complaints of property owners on grievance day and may make 
adjustments to assessments. The board of assessment review consists of at least three but not more than 
five members appointed by the town board. The majority of the members cannot be officers and employees 
of the town. The town assessor may not serve as a board of assessment review member (Real Property Tax 
Law, Sections 102 (3), (4), and 523).  
Collecting Real Property Taxes  
The responsibility for collecting town, county and special district taxes may be performed by either a tax 
collector or a receiver of taxes and assessments, depending on a town’s classification and structure. The 
taxes collected are turned over to the proper agencies. School taxes are ordinarily levied separately, using 
a duplicate copy of the assessment roll provided for the school board. A receiver in a town of the first class 
generally collects school taxes unless there has been an agreement with the school board to the contrary.  
Town Law spells out the general powers and duties of town officials responsible for collecting taxes (Town 
Law, Sections 35, 36, and 37). In towns of the second class, the office of tax collector or receiver may be 
PAGE 66 
abolished by a resolution of the town board. If these offices are abolished, the duties of tax collection must 
then be performed by the town clerk. Chapter 1 - Town Classes, Officers and Districts 13  
Town Director of Purchasing  
Any town, by resolution, may establish the office of director of purchasing. Centralizing the purchasing 
function in the office of director of purchasing can promote sound purchasing practices by concentrating 
knowledge of purchasing laws, practices and market conditions in one official. In addition, creation of this 
position segregates the purchasing function from other components of the purchasing process, such as the 
receiving and audit functions, thereby improving internal control (Town Law, Sections 20 (3) (e), and 41-b).  
Town Attorney  
Any town may establish the office of town attorney, appoint an individual to serve in that position and fix 
the salary for that position. The individual serving as town attorney is a town officer. Towns that have 
established the office and appointed a town attorney may also contract with other attorneys or law firms 
to provide assistance to the town attorney for specific purposes. Towns that have not established the office 
of town attorney may contract with an outside attorney or law firm to provide professional services and 
legal advice (Town Law, Section 20(2)).  
Town Comptroller  
The town board of any town of the first class, or any town of the second class with a population over 40,000 
according to the latest federal census or State enumeration, may adopt a resolution establishing the office 
of town comptroller and appoint an individual to serve in that position (Town Law, Section 20 (3) (b) ). 
Generally, when a comptroller has been appointed, that individual takes over certain duties that otherwise 
would be the responsibility of the town board and town clerk. These duties include auditing, allowing or 
rejecting claims; preparing abstracts; and filing claims and other related functions. The duties of a town 
comptroller also include auditing the books and records of town officers and employees who received or 
disbursed moneys during the fiscal year (Town Law, Section 34). The town board may also take action to 
confer certain other duties upon the town comptroller, such as being the accounting officer for the town.  
Other Offices  
There are numerous other appointive town offices, including engineer, constable, police officer and dog 
control officer.  
Boards And Special Districts  
Population density, public health and safety concerns, community needs or other circumstances may call 
for special services to be provided in only certain parts of a town. Town Law authorizes the creation of 
PAGE 67 
special districts or improvement areas to provide certain improvements and services to certain parts of a 
town. Numerous types of special districts may be created to provide services such as water, sewer, drainage, 
park, ambulance, public parking, lighting, sidewalk, snow removal, refuse and garbage. 
14 Information for Town Officials  
The approval of the State Comptroller is generally required if the cost of the establishment or extension of 
a special district will be financed by debt and the cost of the district or extension to the “typical property” 
is above the average estimated cost threshold annually computed by the State Comptroller for similar types 
of districts. The State Comptroller must determine whether the public interest will be served by the 
establishment or extension of the district and whether the costs will be an undue burden upon the 
properties benefited.  
The affairs of special districts are generally governed by the town board, but in some instances may be 
handled by a separately elected board of commissioners. Special districts are funded by assessments upon 
the property owners who benefit from the services, as well as by user charges (see Town Law, Articles 12, 
12-A, 13, and 15).

250. Bro. J. Blakely Bey stated that the Holy Prophet said "These Verbal Laws are Everlasting and Eternal just as much as my Written Laws."

251. Bro. Edward Mealy stated that the Holy Prophet said "Make yourself perfect upon all subject matters that you may act intelligent on all lines of procedures"

252. The Holy Prophet once stated that "The grand body shall make the laws and the supreme council shall interpret the laws and be the sole judges of what constitute a violation of the laws that are made"

253. Bro. Edward Mealy El stated that the Holy Prophet said "I have my number, and my work of redeeming you people is finished, and I must now go, or I can’t return; and if I don’t return, I can’t deliver you, and if I don’t deliver you, then my coming is in vain"

254. It is stated by a Moor that He (the Prophet) told the people in Chicago that he was a prophet and to prove it he said the star and crescent would appear together in the heavens on December 19th 1925, it did.

255. Bro. Edward Mealy El stated that the Holy prophet told him "YOU DO WHAT I TELL YOU, NEVER MIND WHAT THEY SAY, I HAVE GIVEN YOU LAW, KORAN, AND CONSTITUTION, AND I EXPECT YOU TO ENFORCE MY LAW, AND DO WHAT I SAY, NEVER MIND WHAT THEY SAY OR DO. THEY CAN DO NOTHING BUT DIE."

256. Bro. Edward Mealy El stated that The Holy Prophet told him "Children, there won't be but a few saved; because you are not going to do what I tell you. Your way you want, and your way you are going to have. But your way leads downward Children; so you better do like I tell you. If you do like I tell you, there is a chance for you, if not; there is nothing for you, but DEATH."

257. The Holy Prophet said "They will take this movement down so low; it will disappear from the face of the earth." 

258. The Prophet said "Hold me up and I will draw all men unto you."


259. The Prophet was quoted as saying "Asiatic Preachers and Masons will be the last to come home.  They will fight me tooth and claw but cannot win."

PRELUDE 
 
THE PROPHET PLEA TO THE NATION FRIDAY, MARCH 1, 1929: 
 “Our Divine and National Movement stands for the specific grand principles of 
Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom and Justice, and I, The Prophet, am applying to all, faithful 
Moors, members (National Citizens), and the American citizen to help me in my great 
uplifting acts of uplifting fallen humanity among the Asiatic race (Black people & Latino 
people) and nation, for I have suffered much and severely in the past through 
misunderstanding of what the movement was dedicated to. 
 It is the Great God Allah, alone that guides the destiny of this Divine and National 
Movement. I know all true American citizens are identified by national descent names 
to answer and apply to the free national constitution of this free National Republic of 
the United States  of America. That is why I am calling on all true national citizens to 
help me morally and financially in my great work I am going to help this national 
government, for without a free national name, without descent flag of your forefathers, 
there is not a national divine title of the government in which we live. 
This id from you true and Divine Prophet unto all American and foreign sympathizers.”

CHAPTER 1 MOORISH LEADER’S HISTORICAL MESSAGE TO AMERICA 
National Edition: Moorish Guide 1928 
  
 In connection with the aims, objectives, rules, and regulations of the Moorish 
Science Temple of America, I deem it proper to submit to you a brief statement of our 
organization, covering its inception, rise and progress and of the Mohammedan religion, 
which I hope will be satisfactory to you and the principles of Love, truth, Peace, 
Freedom, and Justice in your relations with mankind in general. I Further, most 
anxiously hope this brief statement will help you to more clearly see the duty and 
wisdom of at all times upholding those fundamental principles which are desired for 
our civilization of our posterity, such as obedience to law, respect and loyalty to 
government tolerance and unity. 
 We organized as the Moorish Temple of Science in the year of 19251, and were 
legally incorporated as a civic organization under the laws of the State of Illinois, 
November 29th, 1926. The name Moorish Temple of Science was changed to the Moorish 
Science Temple of America, May 1928, in accordance with the legal requirements of the 
Secretary of the State of Illinois. 
 The object of our Organization, is to help in the great program of uplifting fallen 
humanity and teach those things necessary to make our Members (citizens) better 
citizens. A National organization with a Rotarian complexion as it relates to branch 
 
1 The first Islamic organization in America to teach the fallen Asiatic race (Black people & Latino people) about their ancient  Divine Creed of Islam, 
Nationality, and history. Moorish Science Temple of America Established 1913AD. Otherwise known as the National Republic of the United States of America 
PAGE 3 
 
Temples became obvious with the increasing numbers of inquiries from men and 
women in different sections of the country concerning the purpose of the organization. 
There are branch Temples in fifteen (15) different states at this time. 
 Since the work of the Moorish Science Temple of America was largely religious, 
the organization has been legally changed to a religious corporation and an affidavit to 
this effect has been properly filed in the Cook County Records office in Illinois. Inspired 
by the lofty teachings of the Koran, we have it as the revealed word of God Allah. We 
shall foster the principles of its teachings among our members (citizens). This is our 
religious privileges as American citizens, under the laws of one of the greatest 
documents of all time-the American Constitution. 
 The Mohammedan religion2 is the least appreciated and probably the most 
misunderstood of the world’s great religions. This is especially true in our western 
world. Try to understand what Mohammedanism stands for, and some of the things it 
has contributed to the world. 
 Mohammed was the founder of the Mohammedan religion. It originated thirteen 
centuries ago on the Arabian Peninsula, where the stream of commerce and culture 
met and mingled in the Middle Ages, where the markets of exchange were stationed for 
treasures of India and the products of the Mediterranean coast. There, this religion 
was established in the unprecedented short period of twenty years, and unlike many 
other religions, without the aid of any royal patronage and support. Buddhism had its 
Asoka; Judaism its Joshua: Christianity its Constantine; but Mohammedanism had no 
person of royal rank and power to assist in its establishment and spread. Today this 
religion is acknowledged by nearly two hundred and fifty million souls and extends over 
 
2 Today known as Islam from1913-1929 it was also known as Mohammedanism by Moslems. 
PAGE 4 
 
an area equal to one-third of the globe. From Arabia it spread eastward over Persia, 
Turkestan, Afghanistan, westward across Syria, Asia minor, Turkey; southwest to 
Africa, covering  more than half of that continent. It found its way to India, and beyond, 
to the Islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. 
 To the early representatives of this faith the world’s debt is incalculably great. 
For it was they who transmitted the treasures of Greek literature from the Middle Ages 
to the renaissance; they who originated the graceful forms of which the taj mahal and 
Alhambra are the most famous examples. it was they who contributed to the sciences 
of algebra and chemistry, astronomy, and medicine; they who built at Baghdad and 
Cairo the most renowned universities  of the world. during those centuries of 
ecclesiastical despotism when the Christian church suppressed all intellectual 
activities save those that were theological, causing the talent that reproduces to 
supplant the genius that creates. Mohammedans did all in their power to encourage 
and stimulate research in every branch of human inquiry. 
The Moors or Mohammedans added to the beauty and grandeur of Spain. For 
centuries art, science, literature, and chivalry flourished among them, while the rest 
of Europe was still sunk in the gloom of the Dark Ages. The Moors were the most 
ingenious and industrious of the subject of Spain. Their expulsion from Spain in1610 was 
one of the chief causes of decadence of that country, for both agriculture and industry 
fell into decay after their departure. 
 Mohammedasim makes no distinction between high and low, rich, or poor, it is 
like the sky, it has room for all. The Koran should be of interest to all readers. It is the 
Bible of the Mohammedans (Moslems), ruling over the customs and actions of over 200  
PAGE 5 
 
million people. It is a  work of importance whether considered from a religious, 
philosophical, or literary viewpoint. 
 In the promotion of plans for the betterment of mankind there has ever been 
some kind of opposition. And strange as it may seem, such kind of opposition, has come 
from sources where there were nonideas or lack of courage to force attention to ideas. 
Where in church, state or the social community, any attempt to do anything out of the 
usual way, seldom fails to receive criticism. Not because the course cannot be pursued 
legally or that it is unreasonable but because it has been considered in terms as new. 
The Moorish Science Temple of America has received some opposition and 
criticism. In the main the opposition has come from certain Christian ministers. They 
have expressed themselves as being opposed to our propagation of the Mohammedan 
religion possibly because the promotion of the Mohammedan faith among our people in 
the United States is considered by them in terms as something new. Whatever the 
reason may be for their opposition, the legal right to oppose citizens, individuals and 
organizations alike for their religious belief does not exist in the United States. The 
door of religious freedom made by the American Constitution swings open to all, and 
people may enter through I and worship as they desire.  
Without religious freedom, no search for truth would be possible; without 
religious freedom, religious progress would be checked, and we would no longer arch 
forward toward the nobler life our heads and gaze with fearless into the vast beyond, 
seeking a hope eternal. 
It is a sad weakness in us after all, to oppose our fellowmen for their religious 
beliefs, and if there are angles who record the sorrows of men as well and their sins, 
they certainly know how many and deep are the useless sorrows that spring forth from 
PAGE 6 
 
such opposition. Possibly love and time will cancel our ancient hatreds in this regard 
and prove that in mankind, tolerance is better than unwarranted opposition. 
 ECONOMIC SECURITY 
 In connection with our religious aims and beliefs, we must promote economic 
security. The preaching of economic security among us is by no means as widespread 
and intensive as the circumstance demand. No other one thing is more needed among 
us at this time than greater economic power. Better position for our boys and girls 
and bigger incomes will follow our economic security. We shall be secure in nothing 
until we have economic power. A beggar people cannot develop the highest in them, 
nor can they attain to a genuine enjoyment of the spiritualities of life. 
Our men and women and children should be taught to believe in the capacity of our 
group to succeed in business in spite of the trials and failures of some of them. Trials 
and failures in business are by no means confined to any particular group of people, 
some business ventures of all people fail.  
We have many men and women among our people who are shining lights in the business 
world of all the people. It is a sad weakness in us as a people that we have withheld the 
very encouragement, support and patronage that would have made some of our worthy 
business ventures a grand success. And worst of all have joined in the condemnations 
of them when they failed. Except in cases of actual dishonesty, discourtesy, lack of 
service and actual unreliability, our business enterprises in every field of endeavor 
should have full confidence cooperation and patronage whenever and where they can 
be given. 
PAGE 7 
 
Read carefully the doctrines of the Moorish Science temple of Americas, it contains 
our hopes, aims, rules and articles of religion. Every member should have a copy. 
 In conclusion, I urge you to remember there is work enough for all to do in helping 
to build a better world. The problems of life are largely social and economic. In a 
profound sense, they are moral and spiritual. Have lofty conceptions of your duties to 
your country and fellowman in general and especially those with whom you deal. This 
includes such honesty and righteousness as will cause you to put yourself in the other 
fellow’s place. Look for the best in others and give them the best that is in you. Have a 
deeper appreciation for womanhood. Brighten the hopes of our youth in order that 
their courage be increased to dare and do wondrous things. Adhere at all times to the 
principles of love, truth, peace, freedom, and justice. 
 I am your affectionate leader. I shall continue to Labor Day and night, both in 
public and in private, for your good, thereby contributing to the welfare of our country 
and its people as a whole. 
NOBLE DREW ALI 
 
CHAPTER II WHAT IS ISLAM? 
NATIONAL EDITION: MOORISH GUIDE 1929 
 Islam is a remarkably simple faith. It requires man to recognize his duties 
towards God Allah his Creator, and his fellow creatures. It teaches the supreme duty 
of living at peace with one’s surroundings. It is preeminently the religion of peace. The 
very name Islam means peace. The goal of a man’s life, according to Islam, is peace 
with everything. Peace with Allah and peace with man. 
PAGE 8 
 
 The Koran, the Holy book of Islam, tells us that the final abode of man is the 
“House  of Peace.” Where no vain word or sinful discourse will be heard. The Holy Divine 
Prophet Noble Drew Ali says that a follower of Islam in the true sense of the word is 
one whose tongue and thoughts do not hurt others. 
Object of man’s life according to Islam is its complete unfoldment. Islam teaches that 
man is born with unlimited capacities for progress. Islam does not support the idea 
that man was born in sin. It teaches that everyone has within him the seed of perfect 
development and it rest within him the seed of perfect development and it rest solely 
with himself to make or mar his fortune. 
 The cardinal doctrine of Islam is the unity of the Father-Allah. We believe in one 
God Allah who is All God. All Mercy and All Power. He is perfect and holy, All Wisdom, All 
Knowledge, and All Truth. These are some of His great attributes so far as we can 
understand. He is free from all defects, holy and transcendent. He is personal to us in 
so far as we see His attributes working for us and in us; but He is nevertheless, 
impersonal. Because He is infinite, perfect, and Holy, we do not believe that death, 
decay, or sleep overtake Him. Neither do we believe that He is a helplessly inactive and 
inert force. Nothing happens without his knowledge and will. He  neither begets nor is 
He begotten, because these are the trails of frail and weak humanity. 
 This unity of Allah is the first and foremost pillar of Islam and every other belief 
hangs upon it.

CHAPTER III CIVIC MORALITY IN SOCIETY3 
A. Master And Servant4  
a. Repine not O man, at the state of  servitude5 it is the appointment of 
Allah and hath many advantages; it removes you from cares and 
solicitudes in life. 
In life. 
b. The honor of the servant is his fidelity; his highest virtues are 
submission and obedience. 
c. Be patient, therefore, under the reproofs of thy master; and when he 
rebuketh thee, answer not again. The silence of thy resignation shall not 
be forgotten. 
d. Be studious of his interest, be diligent in the affairs, and faithful to the 
trust which he reposeth in thee. 
e. Thy time and thy labor belong unto him. Defraud him not thereof, for he 
payeth thee for them. 
f. And thou who art a master, be just to thy servant if thou expect from 
him fidelity; and reasonable in thy commands if thou expecteth ready 
obedience. 
g. The spirit of a man is in him; severity and rigor may create fear but can 
never command love. 
h. Mix kindness with reproof, and reason with authority; so, shall thy 
admonitions take place in the heart, and his duty shall become his 
pleasure.

i. He shall serve thee faithfully from the motive of gratitude; he shall obey 
thee cheerfully from the principle of love; and fail thou not, in return, to 
give his    diligence and  fidelity their proper reward. 
 
 
MORAL CIVIC DUTIES OF CITIZENS 
CHAPTER IV  
HOLY INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PROPHET:  ‘JUSTICE’ 
 
  
1. The peace of society dependeth on justice; the happiness of individuals, on the 
safe enjoyment of all their possessions. 
2. Keep the desires of thy heart, therefore, within the bounds of moderation; let 
the hand of justice lead them aright. 
3. Cast not an evil eye on the goods of thy neighbor; let whatever is his property 
be sacred from thy touch. 
4. Let no temptation allure thee, nor any provocation excite thee to lift up thy 
hand to the hazard of his life. 
5. Defame him not in his character; bear no false witness against him. 
6. Corrupt not his servant to cheat or forsake him; and the wife of his bosom, O 
tempt not to sin. 
PAGE 11 
 
7. It will be a grief to his heart, which thou canst not relieve; an injury to his life, 
which no reparation can atone. 
8. In thy dealings with men, be impartial and just; and do unto them as thou 
wouldst they should do unto thee. 
9. Be faithful to thy trust and deceive not the man who relieth upon thee; be 
assured, it is less evil in the sight of Allah to steal than to betray. 
10. Oppress not the poor and defraud not his hire the laboring man. 
11. When thou selleth for gain, here the whispering of conscience, and be satisfied 
with moderating; nor from the ignorance of thy buyer take any advantage. 
12. Pay the debts which thou oweth; for he who gave thee credit, relieth upon thine 
honor; and to withhold from him his due, is both mean and unjust. 
13. Finally, O sin of society, examine thy heart, call remembrance to thy aid; and 
if in any of these things thou hath transgressed, make a speedy reparation, to 
the utmost of thy power. 
CHAPTER V  
HOLY INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PROPHET : ‘CHARITY’ 
1. Happy is the man who hath sown in his breast the seeds of benevolence: the 
produce thereof shall be charity and love. 
2. From the fountain of his heart shall rise rivers of goodness; and the streams 
shall overflow, for the benefit of mankind. 
3. He assisteth the poor in trouble; he rejoiceth in furthering the prosperity of 
all men. 
PAGE 12 
 
4. He censureth not his neighbor; he believeth not the tales of envy and 
malevolence; neither repeateth he, their slanders. 
5. He forgiveth the injuries of men, he wipeth them from his remembrance; 
revenge and malice have no place in his heart. 
6. For evil he returneth not evil, he hateth not even his enemies, but requteth 
their injustice with a friendly admonition. 
7. The griefs and anxieties of men excite his compassion; he endeavoreth to 
alleviate the weight of their misfortunes, and the pleasure of success 
rewardeth his labor. 
8. He calmeth the fury, he healeth the quarrels of angry men, and preventeth the 
mischiefs of strife and animosity. 
9. He promoteth in his neighborhood peace and good will, and his name is 
repeated with praise and benedictions. 
CHAPTER VI  
HOLY INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PROPHET:  ‘GRATITUDE’ 
1. As the branches of a tree return their sap to the root, from whence it arose; 
as a river poureth its streams to the sea, whence the spring was supplied; so, 
the heart of a grateful man delighteth in returning a benefit received. 
2. He acknowledgeth his obligation with cheerfulness, he looketh on his 
benefactor with love and esteem. 
3. And if to return it be not in his power, he nourisheth the memory of it in his 
breast with kindness; he forgetteth it not all  the days of his life. 
PAGE 13 
 
4. The heart of the grateful man is like the clouds of heaven which drops upon 
the earth, fruits, herbage, and flowers; but the heart of the ungrateful is like 
a desert of sand which swalloweth with greediness the showers that fall, and 
burieth them in its bosom, and produceth nothing. 
5. Envy not thy benefactor, neither strive to conceal the benefit he hath 
conferred; for though to oblige is better than to be obliged, though the act of 
generosity commandeth admiration, yet the humility toucheth the heart, and 
is amiable on the sight both of Allah and man. 
6. But receive not a favor from the hand of the proud; to the selfish and 
avaricious have no obligation; the vanity of pride shall expose thee to shame; 
the greediness of avarice shall never be satisfied. 
    CHAPTER VII  
THE DIVINE ORIGN OF THE ASIATIC6 NATIONS 
Divine Instructions from the Prophet 
1. The fallen sons and daughters of the Asiatic Nation of North America need to 
learn to love instead of heat; and know of their higher self and lower self. This 
is the uniting of the Holy Koran of Mecca, for the teaching and instructing all 
Moorish Americans, etc. 
2. The key to civilization was and is in the hands of the Asiatic nations. The 
Moorish, who were the ancient Moabites, and the founders of the Holy City of 
Mecca. 
 
6 Asiatic is the true name of the race of those. 
People in North America, Central and South America 
And those misnomer, Black People, Latino People, 
PAGE 14 
 
3. The Egyptians who were the Hamitites and of a direct descendant of Mizraim, 
the Arabians, the seed of Hagar, Japanese, and Chinese. 
4. The Hindoos of India, the descendants of the ancient Canaanites, Hittites, and 
Moabites from the land of Canaan. 
5. The Asiatic nations and countries in North, South and Central America; the 
Moorish Americans and Mexicans in North America, Brazilians, Argentinians, 
and Chileans in South America. 
6. Columbians, Nicaraguans and the natives of San Salvador in Central America, 
etc. All of these are Moslems. 
7. The Turks are the true descendants of Hagar, who are the chief protectors of 
the Islamic Creed of Mecca; beginning from Mohammed the First, the founder 
of the uniting of Islam, by the command of the great universal God-Allah. 
Conclusion 
Prophets Are Sent from Allah in whatever time He see fit. 
The news of a Prophet of Allah the Great God of the universe, was sent to redeem 
his people from their sinful ways in this modern time sounds obscure as if to say, “in 
our time a prophet hard to believe”.  Even though skepticism may prevail, the fact of 
the matter is, a prophet comes in line with the law of the Holy Quran of Mecca or from 
the religious doctrine of the people sent to. 
We are never to bold to question how Allah see fit to guide or leaves stray a 
people or nation. Confirmation that Allah sends prophets (messengers) to the 
people of that prophet’s nation or people; no matter what era in time and they are 
always the seal of their time. (See Surah 14:4 in the Holy Quran) 4.“We did not send a 
PAGE 15 
 
Messager except (to teach) in the language of his (own) people, in order to make 
(things) clear to them. Now Allah leaves straying those whom he pleases and guides 
whom He pleases: and He is Exalted in Power, full of Wisdom.” 
 In the language of his own people... this statement is very important it implies 
that prophets are sent to their people speaking the language that they (the prophet) 
grew up with. 
As we see in the Holy Quran of Mecca Surah 14:5-6,9. 
5.“We sent Moses with Our Signs (and the Command)...6. Remember! Moses said to 
his people...” 
9.“Has not the story reached you (O people!), of those who (went) before you? – of the people of Noah, and Ad, and Thamud...? ” 
Surah 10:47 To every people an Apostle: (Messager), when their Apostle comes, the 
matter will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged. 
Surah 10:49 “Say: “...To every people is a term appointed: when their term is reached, 
not an hour can they cause delay, nor can they advance (it in anticipation). 
As we can see those who follow the Islamic religion; Allah sends every people or 
nation a Prophet (Messager, Apostle) to lead them right. As is the case with the fallen 
sons and daughters of the Asiatic race of North America etc. who were strip of their 
language, history, their religion, and culture during the times of slavery in North 
America from 1779 until 1865; and believed themselves to be Negros, Latinos, Colored 
People, and African Americans to this very day.  
PAGE 16 
 
So, the Great God of the universe sent a prophet to North America in 1912AD to 
the Asiatic race to teach them to love instead of hate and about their Divine Creed and 
how to come back under their vine and fig tree of Islamism and return to their own and 
be one with their Father God-Allah. 
Such a prophet is Noble Drew Ali, Allah’s holy and Divine Prophet speaking the 
language of his people; giving them a message of Love to get them back under their 
vine and fig tree to this very day; to be saved from the wrath of Allah.

PREFACE  
“There is but one Allah, the author, the creator, the governor of the world, almighty, 
eternal, and incomprehensible.” RE: HKMSTA1 Ch. XXXV: 1 1 
“He hath instituted laws for the government of the world; He hath wonderfully varied them in 
all beings; and each, by his nature conformeth to His will.” HKMSTA Ch. XXXV: 10  
As a Moorish American we are instructed to “Know thyself and Allah.” This is “Thee Law” the 
science of Moorish Science also known as the “Knowledge of Self” and/or the ‘path’ or ‘way’ or 
life. To accomplish such a lofty idea is to be on the path, “Islamism” or Peace, the Divine 
instructions for all Moslems; Peace with God, Man, Nature/ones surroundings for a 
simplified understanding. As a Grand Sheik meaning one proficient in the degrees of law 
to understand the way, so as to further instruct and be of service to ones brothers & sisters 
and others on the path. Thus said it is understood… “The way, is life, and life is the path, 
of “Thee Law”2 “; deeper still, being the very law one comes to manifest. All Law is 
established in ‘Truth’ which is Holy Breath, Aught, Allah (All -La (h) w). Truth is 
that which changes not.  
In the divine instructions for Man it is understood that “… In all the world there are two 
things. The one is truth, the other is falsehood, and falsehood is that which seems to be. 
Now truth is aught and has no cause, and yet it is the cause of everything. Falsehood is 
naught and yet it is the manifest of right. Whatever has been made will be unmade; that 
which begins must end.” HKMSTA Ch. VII: 4-7 –  
“Man is truth and falsehood strangely mixed.” Man is breath made flesh; so truth and 
falsehood are conjoined in him and then they thrive, and naught goes down and man as 
truth abides.” Ch.VII:13 [speaking; {Public Minister}-day star from on high, aka Jesus the Christ] 
In the light of the above… “Thee Law is the unshakeable pillars of truth, dispelling the 
darkness of falsehood, reveling the light, to settle in peace.”

PAGE 2 
Laws for civilized Governments, their Religions, Science, Philosophy are grown 
out of this ‘Force’ of nature and its natural development constituted by a Prophet of Allah, 
one sent to deliver “Thee Law “and appoint those faithful to the truth, (trustee); for the 
greatest development of its people to their highest potential which is the nature of its 
source, that being Truth. In essence all true and divine laws come from Allah and due to 
the divine nature of Allah the laws from Allah to Man are to guide, to instruct to a perfect 
state of being or being Peace itself. It is the need for civilized man to develop ways and 
paths to better comprehend true Law or the ‘Force’, more comprehensively understood the 
Will of Allah, and institute civilizations that harmonize with that Will. (i.e. Moorish

Allah” through His Holy and Noble Prophet Drew Ali.(Amen).

We organized as The Moorish Temple of Science in the year of 1925, and where legally 
incorporated as a civic organization under the laws of the state of Illinois, November 29th 
1926. The name Moorish Temple of Science changed to the Moorish Science Temple of 
America, May 1928, in accordance with the legal requirements of the Secretary of state of 
Illinois. The RCA (Religious Corporation Act of 1871) provides that “[a]ny church, 
congregation or society formed for the purpose of religious worship, may become 
incorporated” in the manner specified in the Act 805 ILCS 110/35, Ch. 32 and their 
subordinate bodies may become incorporated in like manner under the head organization 
805 ILCS 110/46a-46k Ch. 36; supra said Branch Temple No. 43 became incorporated in

like manner in 2014. Some states and attorneys are simply not aware that the RCA is a 
legal alternative to the NFPCA.  
That, our Divine and National Movement stands for the specific grand principles 
of Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom and Justice. A national organization with a Rotarian 
complexion as it relates to districts branch temples in different sections of the country.

them and family. In the Divine plan of the Ages our Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali and 
Founder of the Moorish Science Temple of America He has given us the means to dispel 
any forms of Mental Slavery caused from a European psychology. We shall teach from the 
Divine Instructions for the fallen sons and daughters of the Asiatics of North America, so 
as to give you instructions on how to Love and stop the hate and destruction of one’s self

As a Moorish American we are instructed to “Know thyself and Allah.” This is “Thee Law” the science of 
Moorish Science also known as the “Knowledge of Self” and/or the ‘path’ or ‘way’ or life. To accomplish such a 
lofty idea is to be on the path, “Islamism” or Peace, the Divine instructions for all Moslems; Peace with God, 
Man, Nature/ones surroundings for a simplified understanding. As a Grand Sheik meaning one proficient in 
the degrees of law to understand the way, so as to further instruct and be of service to ones brothers & sisters

Disclamer 
This book has come into the manifest from the need for a single source of material were  all  the Holy Prophets Divine Laws, Rules and 
Regulations are compiled so as to make it easier referencing the laws while studying the laws that govern Moorish Americans,  and 
family and Nation. This is not an attempt to make any laws or enforce any laws or to cause confusion. To ensure this is the case we have 
only defined and copied the Divine laws as laid down to us by our Holy Prophet we did not interpret. Every Divine Law as spoken by 
the Prophet Noble Drew Ali is within this Law book as of the writing of this book. I, Mr. C. Jones Bey Historian of Temple No. 24, 
currently Grand Sheik of MSTA Temple 43 Los Angeles Calif.  Also we have defined all words from certain documents that the holy 
Prophet spoke on. We have defined the words through the Moorish Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America and Blacks 
Laws dictionaries we have pieced together the history of our Prophet Noble Drew Ali from word of mouth passed down through our 
elders and sheiks and from recorded history of newspaper articles. Mostly from Moorish Guide New Papers of the late 20’s; some events 
will become more accurate as the documented facts become more assessable. One must know the laws that govern you so that you will 
always be in compliance and  know if you are being misused by others, ignorance of the law is now excuse, ignorance of the facts can 
be excused until you get the facts.  I would like to state that it would do one well to find an unabridged dictionary the older the better 
also an Oxford international dictionary to study from also. We have also compiled and prepared a concordance of the Holy Koran of the 
Moorish Science Temple of America for those academics and faithful Moorish Americans.

PURITY 
Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey edited by Amy Jacques-Garvey 
History is the landmark by which we are directed into the true course of life. The history 
of a 
movement, the history of a nation, the history of a race is the guide-post of that 
movement’s 
destiny, that nation's destiny, that race's destiny. What you do today that is worthwhile, 
inspires 
others to act at some future time. 
Chance has never yet satisfied the hope of a suffering people. Action, self-reliance, the 
vision of 
self and the future have been the only means by which the oppressed have seen and 
realized the 
light of their own freedom. 
Life is that existence that is given to man to live for a purpose, to live to his own 
satisfaction and 
pleasure, providing he forgets not the God who created him and who expects a spiritual 
obedience and observation of the moral laws that He has inspired. 
There is nothing in the world common to man, that man cannot do. 
The ends you serve that are selfish will take you no further than yourself; but the ends you 
serve 
that are for all, in common, will take you even into eternity. 
It is only the belief and the confidence we have in a God why man is able to understand 
his own 
social institutions, and move and live like a rational human being. Take away the highest 
ideal: 
PAGE 17 
faith and confidence in a God, and mankind at large is reduced to savagery and the race 
destroyed. 
A race without authority and power, is a race without respect. 
Criticism is an opinion for good or ill, generally indulged in by the fellow who knows 
more than 
anyone else, yet the biggest fool. There is no criticism that calls not forth yet another. The 
last 
critic is the biggest fool of all, for the world starts and ends with him. He is the source of 
all 
knowledge, yet knows nothing, for there is not a word one finds to use that there is not 
another 
that hath the same meaning, then wherefore do we criticize? 
Fear is a state of nervousness fit for children and not men. When man fears a creature like 
himself he offends God, in whose image and likeness he is created. Man being created 
equal 
fears not man but God. To fear is to lose control of one's nerves; one's will, to flutter, like a 
dying 
fowl, losing consciousness, yet alive. 
Ambition is the desire to go forward and improve one's condition. It is a burning flame 
that lights 
up the life of the individual and makes him see himself in another state. To be ambitious 
is to be 
great in mind and soul; to want that which is worthwhile and strive for it; and to go on 
without 
looking back, reaching to that which gives satisfaction. To be humanly ambitious is to take 
in the 
world which is the province of man; to be divinely ambitious is to offend God by rivaling 
him in 
His infinite majesty. 
Admiration is a form of appreciation that is sometimes mistaken for something else. 
There may 
PAGE 18 
be something about you that suggests good fellowship when kept at a distance, but in 
closer 
contact would not be tolerated, otherwise it would be love. 
Religion is one's opinion and belief in some ethical truth. To be a Christian is to have the 
religion 
of Christ, and so to be a believer of Mohammed is to be a Mohammedan but there are so 
many 
religions that every man seems to be a religion unto himself. No two persons think alike, 
even if 
they outwardly profess the same faith, so we have as many religions in Christianity as we 
have 
believers. 
Death is the end of all life in the individual or the thing; if physical, the crumbling of the 
body 
into dust from whence it came. He, who lives not uprightly, dies completely in the 
crumbling of 
the physical body, but he who lives well, transforms himself from that which is mortal, to 
immortal. 
Faithfulness is actuated by a state of heart and mind in the individual that changes not. 
No one is 
wholly faithful to a cause or an object, except his heart and mind remain firm without 
change or 
doubt. If one's attitude or conduct changes toward an object, then one has lost in one's 
faithfulness. It is a wholeness of belief overshadowing all suspicion, all doubt, admitting of 
no 
question; to serve without regret or disgust, to obligate one's self to that which is 
promised Or 
expected, to keep to our word and do our duty well. 
There are but few faithful people now-a days. 
Prohibition is to abstain from intoxicating liquor, as it makes us morbid and sometimes 
drunk. 
PAGE 19 
But we get drunk every day, nevertheless, not so much by the strength of what we sip from 
the 
cup, but that which we eat, the water we drink, and the air we inhale, which at 
fermentation 
conspire at eventide to make us so drunk and tired that we lose control of ourselves and 
fall 
asleep. Everybody is a drunkard, and if we were to enforce real prohibition we should all 
be 
dead. 
There is no strength but that which is destructive, because man has lost his virtues, and 
only 
respects force, which he himself cannot counteract. This is the day of racial activity, when 
each 
and every group of this great human family must exercise its own initiative and influence 
in its 
own protection, therefore, Asiatices should be more determined to-day than they have 
ever been, 
because the mighty forces of the world are operating against non-organized groups of 
peoples, 
who are not ambitious enough to protect their own interests. 
Wake up Ethiopia! Wake up Africa! Let us work towards the one glorious end of a free, 
redeemed and mighty nation. Let Africa be a bright star among the constellation of 
nations. 
A man's bread and butter is only insured when he works for it. 
The world has now reached the stage when humanity is really at the parting of" the ways. 
It is a 
question of "Man Mind Thyself." 
The political readjustment of the world means that those who are not sufficiently able, not 
sufficiently prepared, will be at the mercy of the organized classes for another one or two 
hundred years. 
The only protection against injustice in man is power: physical, financial and scientific. 
PAGE 20 
The masses make the nation and the race. If the masses are illiterate, that is the judgment 
passed 
on the race by those who are critical of its existence. 
The function of the Press is public service without prejudice or partiality, to convey the 
truth as it 
is seen and understood without favoritism or bias. 
Education is the medium by which a people are prepared for the creation of their own 
particular 
civilization, and the advancement and glory of their own race. 
Nationhood is the only means by which modern civilization can completely protect 
itself. 
Independence of nationality, independence of government, is the means of protecting not 
only 
the individual, but the group. Nationhood is the highest ideal of all peoples. 
The evolutionary scale that weighs nations and races, balances alike for all peoples; hence 
we 
feel sure that someday the balance will register a change for the Asiatic. 
If we are to believe the divine injunction, we must realize that the time is coming when 
every 
man and every race must return to its own "vine and fig tree." 
Let Africa be our guiding star: our star of destiny. 
So many of us find excuses to get out of the Asiatic race, because we are led to believe that 
the 
race is unworthy, and that it has not accomplished anything. Cowards that we are! It is we 
who 
are unworthy, because we are not contributing to the uplift and up-building of this noble 
race. 
How dare anyone tell us that Africa cannot be redeemed, when we have 400,000,000 men 
and 
women with warm blood coursing through their veins? The power that holds Africa is not 
divine. 
PAGE 21 
The power that holds Africa is human, and it is recognized that whatsoever man has done, 
man 
can do. 
We of the Asiatic race are moving from one state of organization to another, and we shall 
so 
continue until we have thoroughly lifted ourselves into the organization of government. 
Be as proud of your race today as our fathers were in the days of yore. We have a beautiful 
history, and we shall create another in the future that will astonish the world. 
Woman 
What the night is to the day, is woman to man. The period of change that brings us light 
out of 
darkness, darkness out of light, and semi-light out of darkness are like the changes we find 
in 
woman day by day. She makes one happy, then miserable. You are to her kind, then 
unkind. 
Constant yet inconstant. Thus we have woman. No real man can do without her. 
Love 
A happy but miserable state in which man finds himself from time to time; sometimes he 
believes he is happy by loving, then suddenly he finds how miserable he is. It is all joy, it 
sweetens life, but it does not last. It comes and goes, but when it is active, there is no 
greater 
virtue, because it makes one supremely happy. We cannot hold our love, but there is one 
love 
that never change or is mistaken, and that is God's. The longer we hold our love, the 
nearer we 
approach like unto our Creator. 
The whole world is run on bluff. No race, no nation, no man has any divine right to take 
advantage of others. Why allow the other fellow to bluff you? 
Every student of political science, every student of economics knows that the race can 
only be 
PAGE 22 
saved through a solid industrial foundation; and that the race can only be saved through 
political 
independence. Take away industry from a race; take away political freedom from a race, 
and you 
have a group of slaves. Peoples everywhere are travelling toward industrial opportunities 
and 
greater political freedom. As a race oppressed, it is for us to prepare ourselves that at any 
time 
the great change in industrial freedom and political liberty comes about, we may be able 
to enter 
into the new era as partakers of the joys to be inherited. 
Lagging behind in the van of civilization will not prove our higher abilities. Being 
subservient to 
the will and caprice of progressive races will not prove anything superior in us. Being 
satisfied to 
drink of the dregs from the cup of human progress will not demonstrate our fitness as a 
people to 
exist alongside of others, but when of our own initiative we strike out to build industries, 
governments, and ultimately empires, then and only then will we as a race prove to our 
Creator 
and to man in general that we are fit to survive and capable of shaping our own destiny. 
The world ought to know that it could not keep 400,000,000 Asiatices down forever. 
There is always a turning point in the destiny of every race, every nation, of all peoples, 
and we 
have come now to the turning point of the Asiatic, where we have changed from the old 
cringing 
weakling, and transformed into full-grown men, demanding our portion as men. 
I am not one of those Christians who believe that the Bible can solve all the problems of 
humanity. The Bible is good in its place, but we are men. We are the creatures of God. We 
have 
PAGE 23 
sinned against Him; therefore it takes more than the Bible to keep us in our places. 
Man is becoming so vile that to-day we cannot afford to convert him with moral, ethical, 
physical truths alone, but with that which is more effective—implements of destruction. 
Leadership means everything: pain, blood, death. 
To be prosperous in whatever we do is the sign of true wealth. We may be wealthy in not 
only 
having money, but in spirit and health. It is the most helpful agency toward a self
satisfying life. 
One lives, in an age like this, nearer perfection by being wealthy than by being poor. To 
the 
contended soul, wealth is the stepping stone to perfection; to the miser it is the nearest 
avenue to 
hell. I would prefer to be honestly wealthy, than miserably poor. 
To be free from temptation of other people's property is to reflect the honesty of our own 
souls. 
There are but few really honest people, in that between the thought and the deed we make 
ourselves dishonest. The fellow who steals, acts dishonestly. We can steal in thought as 
well as 
in deed, therefore to be honest is a virtue that but few indulge. To be honest is to be 
satisfied, 
having all, wanting nothing. If you find yourself in such a state then you are honest, if not 
the 
temptation of your soul is bound to make you dishonest. This applies to the king and the 
peasant alike. 
All peoples are struggling to blast a way through the industrial monopoly of races and 
nations, 
but the Asiatic as a whole has failed to grasp its true significance and seems to delight in 
filling only that place created for him by the white man. 
PAGE 24 
The Asiatic who lives on the patronage of philanthropists is the most dangerous member 
of our 
society, because he is willing to turn back the clock of progress when his benefactors ask 
him so 
to do. 
No race in the world is so just as to give others, for the asking, a square deal in things 
economic, 
political and social. 
Men who are in earnest are not afraid of consequences. 
No one knows when the hour of Africa's redemption cometh. It is in the wind. It is 
coming. One 
day, like a storm, it will be here. When that day comes all Africa will stand together. 
Any sane man, race or nation that desires freedom must first of all think in terms of blood. 
Why, 
even the Heavenly Father tells us that "without the shedding of blood there can be no 
remission 
of sins?" Then how in the name of God, with history before us, do we expect to redeem 
Africa 
without preparing ourselves, some of us to die. 
I pray God that we shall never use our physical prowess to oppress the human race, but we 
will 
use our strength, physically, morally and otherwise to preserve humanity and civilization. 
For over three hundred years the white man has been our oppressor, and he naturally is 
not going 
to liberate us to the higher freedom, the truer liberty, and the truer democracy. We have 
to 
liberate ourselves. 
Every man has a right to his own opinion. Every race has a right to its own action; 
therefore let 
no man persuade you against your will, let no other race influence you against your own. 
The greatest weapon used against the Asiatic is disorganization. 
PAGE 25 
If you have no confidence in self you are twice defeated in the race of life. With confidence 
you 
have won even before you have started. 
At no time within the last five hundred years can one point to a single instance of the 
Asiatic as a 
race of haters. The Asiatic has loved even under severest punishment. In slavery the 
Asiatic loved 
his master, he safe-guarded his home even when he further planned to enslave him. We 
are not a 
race of haters, but lovers of humanity's cause. 
Mob violence and injustice have never helped a race or a nation, and because of this 
knowledge 
as gathered from the events of ages, we as a people in this new age desire to love all 
mankind, 
not in the social sense, but in keeping with the divine injunction "Man Love Thy Brother." 
Preparedness is the watch-word of this age. For us as a race to remain, as we have been in 
the 
past, divided among ourselves, parochialtizing, insularizing and nationalizing our 
activities as 
subjects and citizens of the many alien races and governments under which we live—is 
but to 
hold ourselves in readiness for that great catastrophe that is bound to come—that of racial 
extermination, at the hands of the stronger race—the race that will be fit to survive. 
Humanity takes revenging crime from one age to the next, according to the growth and 
development of the race so afflicted. But the perpetuation of crime through revenge and 
retaliation will not save the human race. 
Europe is bankrupt today, and every nation within her bounds is endeavoring to find new 
openings, new fields for exploitation—that exploitation that will bring to them the 
resources, the 
revenue and the power necessary for their rehabilitation and well-being. We are living in a 
PAGE 26 
strenuous, active age, when men see, not through the spectacles of sympathy, but demand 
that 
each and every one measures up in proportion to the world's demand for service. 
The attitude of the white race is to subjugate, to exploit, and if necessary exterminate the 
weaker 
peoples with whom they come in contact. They subjugate first, if the weaker peoples will 
stand 
for it; then exploit, and if they will not stand for subjugation nor exploitation, the other 
recourse is extermination. 
If the Asiatic is not careful he will drink in all the poison of modem civilization and die 
from the effects of it.

Holy Breath of History Bey & El 
The eptomology of the term Moor has the ancient root MR [vowels are interchangeable the 
root of a word is its continents  ] found in Mauraysh (Moorish) also known as TaMaRian 
or MaRu and aMaRuKa i.e. the old Moorish language of what has come to be known as 
Egyptian, or Hebrew.  
The scholarship word know as Kemet that has come down to mean black land or Black 
people land is not the true and divine name for ancient Egypt. The ancient hieroglyphic 
clearly shows that the proper term is Ta’MooRi or Ta’MoRi/TaMaRe; MR or Pa-ta-Mera: 
meaning the ancient land of Egypt4. TaMare, land of the Moor is the hidden and true 
Nationality of the real ancient Egyptians. The word KeMiT is a geographical name where 
the praiseworthy black dirt settled. The root word M-R [an abbreviation for Mister, Master, 
Moor,] comes from the old Moorish language or letters [O.M.L.] …

the universal creator Allah himself...” HKMSTA Ch. 47

Bey’s academic discourse. MR has a deeper meaning in relationship to Moorish 
Americans title’s Bey and El. M-R as we are gathering from the supra means Moor

most biblical dictionaries is ‘Baal’. Baal is an ancient Canaanite God sometimes 
referred to as the ‘Storm God’ knowns as Ra, ASR/Osiris, and Murdock among other 
lands. Now Baal is in fact Bey; [Ba’al] is in reality [Ba El], meaning Son of El the [al] 
was drooped but can also be expressed as [IL], or [El]. [Ba’] was transliterated into 
[Bæ] in old English; [Bæ] went into Middle English transliterated into [Bey]. [BaBa] 
anciently means Father and [Ba] means Son, also Babe (Son); [Ba] is where we get 
[Ra] Son/Sun God. Pronounced [Baaa]- Ra, also Rey. Bey (root B-Y) or Bai, meaning 
Noble Priest or Priest King. When the Moroccan Empire ruled the World (also known 
anciently as Egypt, the Capitol Empire of the Dominion of Africa) all 
Bailiff were Bey-liffs. The term Bey became Bay and Bai 5, Obey. Also, using the 
Hammer to pound in the truth; recent archaeological, biblical, and extra biblical 
research has led scholars working in the area of the origins of Israelite religion to 
assert rather boldly and confidently that the original god of Israel was in fact the 
Canaanite deity El.   
The name Israel is not a Yahwistic name. El is the name of the deity invoked 
in the name Israel, which translates: “May El persevere.” This suggests that El was 
seen as the chief god in the formative years of Israel’s religious practices. In fact, the 
etiological story explaining the origin of the name Israel occurs in Genesis 35:9-15, 
where Jacob obtains this name through the blessing of El Shaddai, which is “El of the 
Mountain.”  
Second, there exist numerous parallels and similarities between descriptions 
and cultural terminology used for El in the Canaanite texts and those used for 
Yahweh in the biblical sources (see below). At some point, it is ascertained, the 
cultural worship of Yahweh must have absorbed that of El, through which means 
Yahweh assimilated both the imagery and epithets once used of El.  
5See E.H.D., vol. I, p. 202 and S.O.E.D., P. 137, SB2, SB3. 
See E.A. Willis Budge “An Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary vol.  
1.p.315 & vol. 2 p. 1050  
PAGE 29 
Finally, there is strong confirmation of this assimilation in the biblical record 
itself. In the oldest literary traditions of the Pentateuch, it is El who regularly 
appears and not Yahweh, or Yahweh as El! The patriarchal narratives identify El as 
the deity to whom many of the early patriarchal shrines and altars were built. For 
example, we are informed in Genesis 33:20 that Jacob builds an altar in the old 
cutural  center of the north, Shechem, and dedicates it to “El, god of Israel” (’el ’elohe 
yišra’el ). There is no ambiguity in the Hebrew here: ’el must be translated as a 
proper name, El. The textual tradition from which this text derives, the Elohist, 
ultimately remembers a time when El was the patron god of Israel.  
That El was the deity worshiped at Shechem is also attested in Judges 9:46, which 
speaks of  
the shrine of “El of the covenant.” The god of the shrine at Bethel, which literally 
translates, “house of El,” is additionally El—”I am El of Bethel” (Gen 31:13; cf. 35:7)—
and appears to Jacob as El Shaddai (35:11; cf. 48:3). Jacob has another encounter with 
El at Penuel, which is so named because Jacob sees El face-toface (32:31). Moreover, 
Isaac blesses Jacob through El Shaddai (28:3), and likewise Jacob blesses Joseph  
“by El of your fathers” (49:25). “El who sees” is given as the etymology of Beerlahai
roi in Genesis 16:13. And we are informed that Abraham journeys to the old cultural 
shrine at Beersheba, where he plants and worships a tree and calls on the name “El 
the eternal” and at the same time Yahweh (Gen 21:33). Contrary to Genesis 33:20, 
where the Shechemite El is presented unambiguously as the “god of Israel,” in 
Genesis 21:33, El is apparently already assimilated to Yahweh (see below). Finally, 
Genesis 14:18-22 speaks of “El the most high,” of whom the Canaanite Melchizedek is 
priest at Jerusalem.  
This assimilation between Yahweh and El, or El into Yahweh, is present in 
much of the Priestly material as well. In fact, the Priestly source largely advocates 
this assimilation. In Genesis 17:1, the  
Priestly writer states that “Yahweh appeared to Abram and said to him: ‘I am El 
Shaddai.’” And Exodus 6:2-3, in contradiction to J (#11), has Yahweh assert: “I am 
Yahweh. And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as El Shaddai, and I was 
not known to them by the name Yahweh.” Although the verse suggests an 
PAGE 30 
identification between Yahweh and El “of the mountain,” the verse also subtly 
recognizes an ancient distinction between the god of the patriarchs (El) and the god 
of the Mosaic era (Yahweh). Perhaps it is necessary at this point to ask: Who was El? 
And why is he even mentioned in the Bible in the first place, let alone as the god of 
Israel in the older literary traditions of Genesis?  
Our knowledge of El predominantly comes from The Holy Koran of the Moorish Science 
Temple of America, Divinely prepared by the Noble Prophet Drew Ali 
Also, there is an  invaluable corpus of tablets  discovered of our ancient Moorish 
forefathers in 1929, the year the Holy Prophet ascended out of flesh, they found  in 
the ancient city of Ugarit, a major city-state of the second millennium BC located on 
the northern coast of Syria, modern day Ras Shamra, the Ugaritic tablets they are 
the best available witness to Canaanite religion and religious practices (today 
known as, The Old time religion [Islamism]6), and “to the background from which 
the religion of Israel emerged, and to the Canaanite beliefs that it shared, adopted, 
compromised with, and sometimes rejected.” The Ugaritic literature depicts El as 
the sovereign deity of the Canaanite pantheon. He is frequently referred to as 
“Father of the gods,” “the eternal King,” and “Creator of all living beings.” El’s other 
epithets include: “El the Kind, the Compassionate,” “the Bull,” “the Ageless One,” and 
“the Father of Years.” He is depicted as bearded, and residing in a tent or a 
tabernacle, whose throne rests on Cherubim. He is the god of blessings and of 
covenants.  
Many of these epithets and images later become assimilated to Yahweh. For 
example, Yahweh is often depicted as bearded, as King of the gods, as 
Compassionate, and as residing in a tent, whose throne, like that of El, rests on 
Cherubim. There are, in addition to this, numerous El epithets in various strains of 
biblical tradition—epithets that through a process of assimilation and adoption 
later become associated with Yahweh. We have already encountered El Shaddai, “El 
of the Mountain.” Like Yahweh who is associated with the mountain of Sinai and 
later in eschatological traditions with Zion, so too El resides on a mountain. Other 
6Article from the Moorish Guide national edition 1928 “Islam is a very simple faith. It requires man to recognize his duties towards God Allah, his  
Creator and his fellow creatures. It teaches the supreme duty of living at peace with ones surrounding. It is preeminently the religion of peace…”  
PAGE 31 
patriarchal narratives attest the use of El Olam, “El the Eternal” to whom Abraham 
plants and worships a tree at Beersheba, El Elyon, “El the Most High,” the god of 
Melchizedek (Gen 14:18-24), and El Roi [Rey], “El who sees” (Gen 16:13).  
These various El epithets are associated with different shrines: El Shaddai 
with Bethel, El the Most High, the creator of the heavens and the earth, with 
Jerusalem, El the Eternal with Beersheba, El who sees with Beerlahai-roi, and El the 
god of Israel with Shechem. Many of these shrines and altars to El were established 
by the patriarchs themselves (e.g., Gen 21:33, 28:18, 33:20, 35:14). It has also been 
suggested that the name Yahweh might have originally been a cultural epithet of El! 
The etymology of  
Yahweh, yhwh, is still unclear, but one proposal is to see it as the causative imperfect 
of the Canaanite- 
Proto-Hebrew verb hwy, “to be.”  
It is probable therefore, as many commentators have contended, that the 
early Israelites actually worshiped El through his epithet ‘Yahweh.’ This process of 
assimilation is usually presented the other way around in the biblical literature: 
Yahweh is worshiped through the epithets of El: Shaddai, Olam, and Elyon.  
Contrary to these biblical traditions that suggest an assimilation between 
Yahweh and El, there are other passages that seem to indicate that Yahweh was a 
separate and independent deity within El’s council. Deuteronomy 32:8-9 is one of 
those rare biblical passages that seemingly preserves a vestige of an earlier period 
in proto-Israelite religion where El and Yahweh were still depicted as separate 
deities: Yahweh was merely one of the gods of El’s council! This tradition undeniably 
comes from older Canaanite lore.  
When the Most High (’elyôn) gave to the nations their inheritance, when he 
separated humanity, he fixed the boundaries of the peoples according to the number 
of divine beings. For Yahweh’s portion is his people, Jacob (Ya’cub) his allotted 
heritage.  
There are two points to take away from this passage. First, the passage 
presents an apparently older mythic theme that describes when the divine beings, 
PAGE 32 
that is each deity in the divine counsel, were assigned and allotted their own nation. 
Israel was the nation that Yahweh received. Second, Yahweh received his divine 
portion, Israel [is-ra-el or Isis Ra El], through an action initiated by the god El, here 
identifiable through his epithet “the Most High.” In other words, the passage depicts 
two gods: one, the Most High (El), is seen as assigning nations to the divine beings 
or gods (the Hebrew word is elohim, plural “gods”) in his council; the other, Yahweh, 
is depicted as receiving from the first god, the Most High, his particular allotment, 
namely the people of Israel. Similarly, in another older tradition now preserved in 
Numbers 21:29, the god Chemosh is assigned to the people of Moab.  
Other biblical passages reaffirm this archaic view of Yahweh as a god in El’s 
council. Psalm 82:1 speaks of the “assembly of El,” Psalm 29:1 enjoins “the sons of El” 
to worship Yahweh, and Psalm 89:6-7 lists Yahweh among El’s divine council.  
Thus there seems to be ample evidence in the biblical record to support the 
claim that as Yahweh become the supreme national deity of the Israelites, he began 
to usurp the imagery, epithets, and old cultural centers of the god El. This process of 
assimilation even morphed the linguistic meaning of the name El, which later came 
to mean simply “god,” so that Yahweh was then directly identified as ’el—thus 
Joshua 22:22: “the god of gods is Yahweh” (’el ’elohim yhwh).  
Noteworthy also is the fact that unlike the god Baal [Ba’ El or Bey], there is 
no polemic in the Bible against El, and all the old cultural centers of El, those in 
Jerusalem, Shechem, and Beersheba, were later accredited to Yahweh. Since the 
large majority of patriarchal narratives that speak of shrines and altars to El are 
found in the northern kingdom, such as Bethel and Shechem, and, on the other hand, 
many biblical texts seem to accredit Yahweh’s origin to the southern Negeb, the 
current scholarly hypothesis is that the worship of El in the north and of Yahweh in 
the south eventually merged. 7 Dang did we just get all that from the root MR, lol 
wow!  }

  On 
January 8th, 1886 in the state of North Carolina, the ushering in of the New Age was crowned 
with Allah’s Holy Prophet being manifested into human flesh. And the earth shook and the 
sky became dark and the people came out of the fields; for the reincarnating Spirit of Jesus was 
born into manifest, to save the Moors from the iron hand oppression, corporate 2nd class 
citizenship of the United States, who were governing a portion of Amexem at this time. By this 
act of Love Allah has distinguished to the Asiatics of the Americas with a particular favor; as 
he has given this distinction to other Nations (Sura 14:4) and (1Peter 2:4-10)This particular 
blessing was, the coming of a Prophet, a Messenger for they are a chosen generation a royal 
priesthood; a holy Nation. 
 The prophet was born Timothy Drew, little is known about his childhood. What is 
known is fragmented; it is told by our Moorish Elders that; Timothy Drew was born to a 
Cherokee Mother {one of the five civilized tribes of Moors} and his Father was an ex-slave. It 
was said that he was raised by his Cherokee family until 1892. Timothy moved to Newark New 
Jersey, and it is here in Newark were his Mother died. Timothy Drew went to live with an aunt. 
As the events unfold; she was a heartless forbidding woman, who tried to push him into a fire 
filled furnace and it was the Father God Allah who sheltered him from the fire. He is said to 
have scars from this incident. Young Timothy Drew left immediately after that and began 
traveling as a young teenager. It is told that young Timothy had uncanny abilities, these gifts 
from Allah most mistook as magic. These abilities landed him a job in the traveling circus, 
were he demonstrated levitation and clairvoyance abilities. During his international travels as 
a merchant seaman, young Timothy heard a voice speak to him with authority yet with a 
stillness and peace; “Go! Where You Go, I Go, I Am with You.” With his Heart guiding him 
he boarded a ship to the Mediterranean Sea. By the age of 15 or 16 Timothy Drew was in Africa, 
Egypt were his divine destiny, is to unfold as the African lotus unfolds on the Nile. Here he 
would live and be instructed, “…prepared divinely in due time by Allah…” He was recognized 
by an Adept Master Mind, a Guru who was said to have been from Punjab, India. Young 
Timothy was taken into the great pyramid Of Khufu with eyes bound, and was released to find 
his way out unassisted or die. They say at dawn he appeared from the sand in between the 
paws of Heru (Sphinx). After about 10 years of applied Adept sciences, he became the Light of 
Moorish Science; he was titled by the Adept Master Minds ‘Angel a Prophet of Allah’. After 
graduating all his degrees young Timothy was received in the Holy City of Mecca as a Moslem, 
one of the highest degrees the Chief Protectors of the Creed of Islam could give. Timothy Drew 
was exalted an given his holy Noble name wile in the Holy City of Mecca in Saudi Arabia El 
Hajj Sharif Abdul Ali and hajj was, in Mecca. Also he was known as Sheik Sharif Abdul Ali. 
El Hajj Sharif Abdul Ali at this time traveled. 
It is also reported around 1911-12 with his exulted authority he met and made alliances 
of Sultan Abdul Aziz Ibu Saud of the Holy City of Mecca, Sultan Fuad of Egypt and the Grand 
Lodge of England-France told. It is also reported he met one by the name of Sulaiman 
Mohammed and Abdul Karim El of Morocco. 
With a mighty Thought and consciousness of his 
mission to the sons of men, in the spring of 1912 
Noble Drew Ali returned to America to fulfill his 
duty as a Prophet. Allah’s Holy prophet was 
given many sacred books unfolding the creations 
of the worlds, the true history of Man, human, 
and mankind; he was taught the Laws that 
govern all events. He was enlightened to all the 
true teaching of all the Prophets of all the Ages 
and climes. He had placed to memory these 
divine books. “I got here just in time” the Prophet 
said that ‘the Europeans were looking for him 
with airplanes and with dread-naught’. When he 
came back into the United States he was asked 
“where are those books that you have?” The Holy 
prophet just smiled, he told the Moors that “the 
books were in his head.”  
The Holy Prophet as the rising Phoenix in the West arrives back in the states from the east; 
Noble Drew Ali helped establish The Canaanite Temple May 1, 1913 in Newark (NewArk) New 
Jersey (New Jerusalem).  
While in the United States the Holy Prophet started working as a Porter on the B&Q Railroad. 
As a porter Noble Drew Ali came in contact with an intelligent Mind, one J. A. Rogers and the 
Holy Prophet began to enlighten J. A. Rogers to his forefather’s divine history.  Soon after his 
divine meetings with the Prophet, J. A. Rogers wrote the book “From Superman to Man”. He 
gave honors to Noble Drew Ali cloaked under the pseudonym ‘Dixon’ a wise Negro porter. 
PAGE 41 
The Holy Kingdom of Ali was being manifested.  
Noble Drew Ali immediately started performing 
the duties of Allah’s holy Prophet; he met with 
soon to be President Woodrow Wilson; and they 
challenged him. Noble Drew Ali being a Prophet 
of Allah, rose up in the higher consciousness and 
spoke, and Light filled the room. “I have come for 
my people” and they asked him “Are you talking 
about the Negroes?” And the Holy Breath replied 
‘There is no Negros, Colored Folks, Black People 
or 
Ethiopians!! They are descendants of the Ancient 
Moabites, who inhabited the Northwest and 
Southwest Shores of Africa! I came for the flag of 
Our Ancient Forefathers.” President Wilson replied 
“It is not your time!” Ali answered ‘I have been 
appointed in due time by Allah the Great God of the 
Universe.’ And one of the President lawyers asked 
“What kind of flag is your flag?”  And Noble Drew Ali 
responded ‘You have it Hidden in Your Vaults!’ So they went to Philadelphia to the vault room, 
they began to bring out all kinds of modern day flags. The prophet stated ‘You know it is much 
older than these.’ They began to dig deeper still and up came a red flag, and they said “this is 
the flag of Morocco.” The Holy Prophet commanded ‘I Am!, here for the Moorish flag, that 
which you call the cherry tree.’ They dusted off a very old flag, a red flag with a five pointed 
green star in the center.( this event is also reported to 
have occurred March 7, 1912; thus Tag Day)  The 
European President and counsel stood in 
astonishment at the exactness of The Holy Prophet. 
The President said ‘We’ve had your people so long 
they will not follow anyone else, and to tell them 
would be like trying to put pants on a mule.” The 
Prophet stated ‘My flock knows my voice.’  
Noble Drew Ali left, and went about his 
Father’s business. May 1, 1916 he would 
further bring the Kingdom of Heave to 
earth ’as above so below’, by the Will of

Allah he would establish the Holy Moabite Temple of the World a Moorish 
Divine and National Movement of North America was thereby established 
for the upliftment of fallen humanity. 
From nineteen sixteen to around 1919 the Prophets missionary work was 
recognizable by the masses of people in New Jerusalem, {New Jersey}. As 
the Egypt Adept Student the Prophet was healing people on a mass level 
at that time with his Oil Tea and Compound; the first to bring us holistic 
health, also teaching educating the Asiatics publicly in barbershops, 
railroad flats and homes of believers.

He was teaching the old time religion of the missing years of Jesus in the Bible.              
In 1919 he moved to New York where he joined Marcus Garvey’s 
Movement the UNIA; known as the African Prince. He also helps organize 
the Moorish Zionist Temple of the Moorish Jews. 
In 1924 The Prophet received a divine revelation to return to the state of 
his birth North Carolina, where he found articles needed for the success 
of his mission. He was Divinely Ordained; here he was given a vision of his 
mission. The Prophet began doing a mighty work proving that this is a 
new Era in time. And after fifty years of scientific achievements, man has 
just about reached the pinnacle of his physical knowledge and wisdom of 
our time, and he now is waiting to see what the new Era brings to the 
human race. And the rest as they say is history.

Jewish elders to the right, one can see the Moorish Zionist Temple of the

Drew Ali would often say that he had a lot of Jonah amongst his membership. 
73. Who is Noble Drew Ali to all Moorish Americans? Ans. Allah Last Prophet in these 
Days. 
PAGE 53 
74. So are all Moorish Americans Moslems? Ans. Yes 
75. And why is that? Ans. All Moorish Americans are Moslems, because Moorish 
Americans are the ‘Faithful’. 
76.  So do Moorish Moslems believe that there are other versions of Prophet Drew Ali?  
Ans. No!  
77. Why is that? Ans. The Divine recorded of Allah remembrance Book declared that 
after the death of all the true and divine Prophets of Allah; being that they are 
Thoughts of Allah manifested, some people had a greater need for a instead 
Prophet to return. A Prophet to appear on the scene. 
78. How is it then that there are so many now calling themselves reincarnated and 
resurrected prophets etc? Ans. Well they are following behind their father Satan 
the Beast who subscribes to himself the titles of God. There was one who was 
actually following the Prophets teachings. 
79. And who was this? Bro. John Given El the one whom some refer to as Saint John 
Given El. 
80. Why is this? Because of all others he remained spiritually and morally closer to 
what the Great Prophet of Allah did bring, after the death of Saint E. Mealy El that 
is. 
81. Why do you believe that so many are attempting to do this? Ans. Well that’s 
simple, after these ones have tried every other scheme which has fallen them the 
only one left is to refer to themselves as being the Prophet in order to draw the 
people to them. 
82. Then why do so many people fall for that trick? Ans. That answer is also easy to 
declare as we previously said that our people are under Mental Slavery. 
83. What does this sort of psychology produce a belief in? Ans. Spookism, which was 
given to our American fathers and mothers who were, forced into the religion of 
Satan the Beast. And so is far easier to mislead them than to lead them right. 
PAGE 54 
84. Why then do they accept such claims of men as Prophets? Ans. Because those who 
follow these sorts of claimers are themselves desires of such fame and titles. But 
they know that there is no truth in what they claim. 
85. And why do you say that they do know better? Ans. Once you have read the life 
works, and teachings of the Great Prophet of Ali; become a Prophet, when we 
Moors only recognize and follow the Divine Teachings of Prophet Drew Ali. Allah 
makes Prophets not Man. 
86. So what are you saying? Ans.  (a) That only Allah makes Prophets for us and Satan 
makes his own and so far not one of these claimers has declared that Allah 
Divinely ordained them, and from their own lip service we can see that they mostly 
depended on the European defined and has set up to become so-called Prophets. 
And other than that their membership depended on an even more mysterious rout 
to prove that these ones are prophets, and they seek to do so by reducing by raising 
87.  Do Moorish Moslems believe in reincarnation?  Ans. Yes we do.  But not in a 
carnal sense. We know that there is no such thing as reincarnation of a body 
already here, that is deemed possession and nor reincarnation of a body already 
here that is deem possession and not another man’s body.  When Jesus resurrected 
he did not come back as Peter or Paul. 
88. Do we Moors accept the Sovereignty Degree? Ans. No! 
89. And Why Not? Ans. Because the Holy Prophet did not bring it. Also the Great 
Prophet Drew Ali both told and instructed us Moslems not to be in the Europeans 
business and not allow him in ours, that we are a wheel within a wheel (Nation 
within Nation) and thus free to act. Ultimately Jesus long ago addressed the 
question about taxes, give to Allah what is Allah’s and render to Caesar what is 
Casers. This makes it very plain to us Moslems what we are to do. 
90. Is there any other support for your position? Ans. How do you expect to get 
freedom form a system that is built on your volunteer slavery and claims you to be 
Black. 
PAGE 55

Politic, back in the constitutional fold of law. 
92. Have there been any lawful titles such as Supreme etc. 
And other titles given within the whole of the Moorish movement? Ans. Yes. 
93. Did our Great Prophet Drew Ali ever use the title Chief? Ans. Yes he did. Our 
Prophet Drew Ali did combine a few titles together for example the title Chief Head 
and Governor, or the title of Head leader etc. 
94. Why did the Prophet establish his organization under the Religious Corporation 
Act? ANS: Because Congress cannot make no law respecting an establishment of 
religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.  
95. Is everything a Moorish American Moslem does that is lawful apart of his religion? 
Ans.  Yes, If the Moorish American is wise. 
96. Is the Moorish Science Temple of America in a jurisdiction on to its own? Yes it is 
a Lawful Body Politic a nation within a nation. 
97. Are the Members apart of that jurisdiction? Yes those Members who uphold their 
covenants especially in Act. 6-7 and obey all the laws of the Holy Prophet Noble 
Drew Ali.

Historical Accounts of Noble Drew Ali’s Divine 
Acts between 1925-1929 
While the Honorable Marcus M. Garvey, the Forerunner of the Prophet was stirring up the 
nations and the Negros of America and the world over; and established himself as Provisional 
President of Africa, Noble Drew Ali, Allah Holy Prophet was establishing  himself in Chicago, 
In 1925, recorded in sealed historical  records ; 5th day of October 1925, that the first temple of 
Islam was established, the first Islamic Institution of higher learning in the west to propagate 
the faith of Mohammad in America , Temple #1 Chicago Ill . As he went through the land 
teaching this new doctrine of Salvation...” Oral tradition speaks on Noble Drew Ali reason for 
leaving Newark (New-Ark) New Jersey (New Jerusalem).  During World War I, the Moors 
refused to fight for the US government and were persecuted and harassed. Noble Drew Ali 
taught Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom and Justice not hate, under his religious right; he was 
driven out of the east coast by the police. Thus he set his roots in Chicago in 1925.   Towards 
the end of the year he goes to Washington D.C. to take possession of our flag and sign up to 
go a certain way in these United State of America. It is reported that around this time is when 
Prophet Drew Ali made his famous Star and Crescent prediction. In December 25, 1925 the 
Chicago Tribune proves the accuracy of the prophecy; the prediction was the star of Islam was 
in the West. The report by the Chicago Tribune stated “The symbol of Islam hung low in the 
western sky last night at sunset. The moon and the planet Venus were in conjunction, with 
Venus following the horns of the crescent moon. The figure of the crescent and star is one of 
the most beautiful sights of the heavens and is rather rare…” 
By 1925 the Prophet incorporated the Moorish Holy Temple of Science and began displaying 
the constitution and issuing the Divine Calling Card and founded the Moorish Manufacturing

Grand Sheik. As reported by the 
1st Supreme Grand Sheik E. Mealy 
El himself.   
“Returning 
from a trip visiting other temples, 
one morning in front of the 
Home Office at 3140 Indiana 
Avenue, the Prophet said to me, ‘E. Mealy El, Brother Mealy, you will study up now on all of 
my laws to prove yourself, because you will have to do what I am doing. You will go around to 
all temples and report back to me. So read up on my Koran, questionnaire, Constitution, and 
try to be perfect on all subjects, so you may act intelligent along all lines of procedure.’ Twenty 
minutes later, in his office on the same occasion, the Prophet Noble Drew Ali said to me ‘I find 
all of them want to sit in my seat, but at my absence, that is your station. Then when you leave, 
lock the desk and put the key in your pocket. Everyone wants to sit there, because that is where 
the money is, but I know who I want to sit there and I know who I want to handle my money.’.” 
1927 The Prophet copyrights the Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America, and 
issues Nationality Cards, the Koran Questions for Moorish Children. The organization also 
purchased a piece of land 37th of Federal and State Street. The land was placed under trust

As the Holy Koran of the Moorish 
Science Temple of America with its 
Testamentary qualities was being issued to the Governors. Allah’s holy prophet Noble Drew 
Ali conscious to the end of time and the fulfilling of the prophecies began demonstrating to 
the Nations of the world and to the Officers of his Nation. 
Moorish elders inform us that the Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali and Bro. C. Kirkman Bey went 
to the Pan American Conference in and around February 1928. At that time, the Holy Prophet 
went there and represented the Moorish Americans, and there was an Indian Chief 
representing the American Indians. The Conference was in Havana, Cuba, and the nations of 
North, South, and Central America were present. Secretary of State Hughes of the United 
States was representing the United States at the conference. Bro. Charles Kirkman-Bey, who 
spoke 7 different languages, was the interpreter for the Holy Prophet at this conference. When 
the Holy Prophet ship was tied up at the dock, the Cuban army was standing on the dock, and 
Bro. Kirkman-Bey said something to them in Spanish, and the army came to attention, and

then he and the Holy came down from the ship. At the conference Bro. C. Kirkman-Bey address 
the conference in both Spanish and Arabic, and when the Secretary of the United States heard 
Bro. Kirkman-Bey speak, he said “That’s a dangerous man.” 
Up to that period of time, the United States received a 50 year mandate for this land. At this 
conference, the mandate for this land was given to Prophet Noble Drew Ali. Bro. G. Cook-Bey 
G.S. (Emeritus) of Temple One said that the Prophet Noble Drew Ali showed us the mandate 
in the Adept Chamber. The conferences was mostly dealing with aliens within the jurisdiction 
of a country and Nationality issues; which is now established as international law as the 
‘Bustamante Codes’

this end upon his recent return from Pine Bluff, Ark., where he spent some days lecturing at 
the local Moorish Temple. This organization is playing a useful and definite part in advancing 
the sacred obligations of American citizenship. Indications are that this convention will be 
one of the most interesting ever held in this city. There will be delegates from 15 different states 
where local temples have been established. There will be an interesting event in which men 
and women members will were regalia similar to that worn in eastern countries. A camel will 
be presented during the session, specific reports of the general work and civil accomplishment 
of local temples. Report of the business enterprises that have been established in connection 
with these temples, such as grocery and market stores in Detroit, a laundry in Pittsburgh, Pa.. 
These examples of collective effort show that the member of the Moorish Temple and their 
leader have a sound economic program and  are blazing a trail and making the pathway over 
which our prosperity may travel unhampered and unafraid. ‘It must be kept in mind that no 
great movement can take definite shape in two years so as to be err proof,’ said President Ali. 
‘However, through accumulation experience each annual convention ought to witness a more 
perfect and wider functioning organization, representing the organized experience of men and 
women member throughout the country and possibly in time the world over’. And continuing, 
PAGE 63 
President Ali said ‘‘Constructive criticisms from sympathetic friends in and outside of our 
organization are welcome’.” In an article after the convention, we read that on the opening 
day that the two Grand Governors; T. Crumby Bey of Pittsburg and Lomax Bey of Detroit read 
reports, alderman Louis B. Anderson gave an opening address and others such as Oscar 
DePriest (Congressman and member), Attorney’s Aaron Payne (member), Richard Ross Bey 
(Sheik and member), Attorney George W. Blackwell, and Claude D. Green (managing editor 
of the Moorish Guide and chairman of the convention arrangements committee) spoke. A 
Moorish parade and the announcement of the Moorish governing council also held interest. 
About this the article states: “It is reported that the prophet, the Supreme Executive Authority, 
will appoint a supreme grand council, of which he will be the grand chairman. The Supreme 
Council will have power and control and supervise all the affairs and properties of the Moorish 
Science Temple of America, and it will become sole judge of what constitutes conduct injurious 
to the order, peace and interest or welfare with its constitution and by-laws, also the rules and 
regulations made by the prophet, and shall be the sole judge of the sufficiency of the evidence 
by which such conduct is shown. Prophet Noble Drew Ali is being congratulated by 
Chicagoans of the success of the Moors’ first annual convention and for his splendid work in 
promoting the cause of human brotherhood The name Moorish Temple of Science was 
changed to The Moorish Science Temple of America.’  
Saturday June 30th, 1928 the Chicago Defender reports “Moorish Leader is Postmaster Guest, 
among the prominent visitors to the Chicago post office this week were President Drew Ali, 
founder of the Moorish Science Temple of America… After a brief but pleasant visit with 
Postmaster Arthur C. Lueder… Afterwards President Ali expressed sincere appreciation for the 
courtesy shown him and his party by the postal authorities.”

(We) need every one of you who think that your condition can be better. This is a field open to 
strong men and women to uplift the nation and take your affaires of men. If the European and

solved only as it can and that is by the Moorish National Divine Movement. If you have a

PROPHET MAKES PLEA TO NATION 
Friday, November 9, 1928  
Our Divine and National Movement stands 
for the specific grand principles of Love, Truth, 
Peace, Freedom, and Justice, and I the 
Prophet am applying to all loyal, faithful 
Moors, members and the American citizen to 
help me in my great uplifting acts of uplifting 
fallen humanity among the Asiatic race and 
nation. I have suffered much and severely in 
the past through misunderstanding of what 
the movement was dedicated to. 
 It is the 
Great God Allah, alone, that guides the 
destiny of this Divine and National Movement. I know all true American citizens are identified 
by national descent names to answer and apply to the free National Constitution of this free 
National Republic of the United States of America. That’s why I am calling on all true national 
citizens to help me morally and financially in my great work I am going to help this national 
government. F or without a free national name, a descent flag your forefathers, there is not a 
national divine title of the government in which we live.     
                                         
                                             –Prophet Noble Drew Ali- 
 
 
 
 
 
THE PROPHETS WARNING TO THE NATION 
FRIDAY, NOVERMBER 30, 1928 
The citizens of all free National Governments, according to their National Constitution, are 
all of one family bearing one free National name. Those who fail to recognize the free National 
name of their Constitutional Government are classed as undesirable, and are subject to all 
inferior names and abuses and mistreatments that the citizen cares to bestow upon them. And 
it is a sin for any group of people to violate the National Government; and cling to the names 
and principles that delude to slavery.  
I, the Prophet, was prepared by the Great God Allah, to warn my people to repent from their 
sinful ways, and go back to that state of mind to their forefathers’ Divine and National 
Principles- that they will be law abiders and receive their divine right as citizen according to 
the free national Constitution that was prepared for all free National being-they are to claim 
their own free National name and religion. 
There is but one issue for them to recognize by this Government and of the earth, and that 
comes only through the connection of the Moorish Divine National Movement and recognized 
by all other nations of the world. And through it they and their children can receive their divine 
rights, unmolested by other citizens. 
That they can cast a free National ballot to the polls under the free National Constitution of 
the United States Government, and not a “Granted Privilege” as has been the existing 
condition for many generations. 
PAGE 71 
You, who doubt whether I, the Prophet, and my principles are right for the redemption of my 
people, go to those that know the law in City Hall and among the officials in your government 
and ask them under intelligent tone and they will be glad to render you a favorable reply; for 
the are gold to see me bring you out of the darkness into light. 
Money does not make a man; it is free national standers and power that make a man and 
nation. The wealth of all National governments, gold d sliver commerce, belong to the citizen 
alone; and without your national citizenship y name and principle, you have no true wealth. 
And I am herby call on all true citizens that stand for a National  
Free Government and the enforcement of the Constitution to help me in my great missionary 
work, because I need all support from all true American of the United States of American 
citizen f the United States of America. Help me to save y people, who have fallen from the 
Constitutional laws f this government. I am depending on your support to get them back to 
hem Constitutional fold again, that they will learn to love, Truth, Peace, Freedom and Justice, 
support our free National Constitution of the united States of America. 
I love my people, and I desire their unity and mine back to their own free national and Divine 
Standard, because day by day they have been violation the National and Constitutional Laws 
of their government by calming names and principles that are constitutional. If Italians, Greek, 
English, Chinese, Turks and Arabians are forced to proclaim their free national name and 
religion before the Constitutional Government of the United States of America, it is no more 
than right that the law should be forced upon all American citizens alike. In all other 
governments, when a man is born and raise there and asked his name of national decent and 
name if he fails to give it is misused, imprisoned, or exiled. Any group of people who fail to 
answer up to the Constitutional Standards of Law by name principle, become to be a citizen 
of any government you must claim your National name descent. Because they place their trust 
upon issue and names that they are not a part and partial of, and nether were they formed by 
their forefathers. The word ‘Negro” deludes in Latin language to the word “nigger”; the same, 
the word “colored” deludes to anything that is painted, varnished, and dyed. /and every nation 
must bear a national descent name of their forefathers, because honoring thy father and thy 
mothers, your days will be lengthened upon this earth. These names have never been 
recognized by any true American citizens of this day. 
PAGE 72 
Through your free National name, you are known and recognized by all nations of the earth 
that are recognized by said national government in which they live. The 14th and 15th 
amendments brought the North and South in unity; placing the Southerner, which was at that 
time without power, with the Constitutional Body of power. And at that time, 1865, the free 
national Conational Law that was enforced since 1774 declared by the Free National 
Constitution to be free and equal, since that Constitution has never been changed, there is no 
need for the application of the 14th and 15th Amendments for the Salvation of our people and 
citizens. 
So, there isn’t but one supreme issue for my people to use to redeem that which was lost, and 
that is through the above statements, then the lion and the lamb can lie down to gather in 
yonder hills and neither will be harmed; because Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom and Justice will 
be reigning in this land. In those days the United Stated will be one of the greatest civilized 
and prosperous government of the world, but if the above principles are not carried out by the 
citizen and my people in this government, the worst is yet to come, because the Great God of 
the Universe is not pleased with the work that are being performed in North America by my 
people, and this great sin must be removed from the land to save it from enormous 
earthquakes, diseases, etc. 
And I, the Prophet, do herb believe that this administration of the government being more 
wisely prepared by more genus citizen that believe in their free National Constitution and 
Laws, and through the help of such classes of citizen, I, the Prophet, truly believe that my 
people will find the true and divine way of their forefathers, and learn to stop serving carnal 
customs and merely ideas of man, that have never done them any good- but has always 
harmed them. 
So I, the prophet, an hereby calling aloud, with a divine plea, to all true American citizens, to 
help me remove this great sin which has been committed and is being practiced b my people 
PAGE 73 
PAGE 74 
in the United States of America; because they know it is not the true and divine way, and 
without understanding they have fallen from the true light into utter darken of in, and there 
is no a nation on earth today that will recognize them socially, religiously politically, 
economically, etc, in their present condition of endearment , in which they them try to force 
upon a civilized world, They will not refrain from their sinful ways of action and their deeds 
have brought “Jim-Crowism,  segregation”  and everything that bring to human beings on 
earth. And they fought the Southerners for all these great misuses, but I have traveled in the 
South and have examined conditions there, and it I the work of my people continuously prating 
the things which bring dishonor, disgrace, and disrespect to any nation that lives the life. And 
I am hereby calling on all true American citizens for moral support and finance to help me in 
my great missionary work to bring my people out of darkness into marvelous light. 
                                              From THE PROPHET  
 
  
“Masterpiece of Religious Literature: Secrets of 
Other Creeds Revealed” 
By Prophet Noble Drew Ali 
Reprinted from the Moorish Guide of Friday, December 
1, 1928 
The Prophet Noble Drew Ali has spent many hours preparing 
the latest edition of the Koran, which will be a masterpiece of 
religious Literature. To Americanize the Oriental idea of Islam 
involves much change that is more or less negative to the aim 
purpose carefully considered with the idea to avoid changing 
the complexion of the original text. 
The Philosophy of the ancient Prophets is the main initiative in the compilation of the Koran. 
No thoughts of propaganda enter this work, as has been the case of many former religious 
work, such as the Bible and other books of creed. The sole purpose of the Prophet in giving 
such a message to the world is to save fallen humanity. When a compiler attempt to inject 
propaganda into a work of this kind, there arises a need to cover the true text in order to 
prevent a clash with the truth and ideas involved in such propaganda. 
Former work of this kind have ether hindered or helped the nations proportionately to the 
adherence to the truth and to the original purpose keeping the ignorant in such a state. It is 
hard to resist the temptation to use this medium for gain. Hence, many of the former treaties 
in works of this kind have been the means to foster ideas of the unscrupulous wherein they 
desire to use religious influence for gain. 
The many secrets known to the Prophet that could be used for the salvation of the nation were 
either let out or colored to an extent that their meaning was made void. Such is not the case 
with this edition n of the Koran. 
All the secrets of the ages known to man are put into this work. The secrets, known only to 
the Magi, are here revealed: the reading of the stars, the interoperation of marriage relations, 
PAGE 75 
the understanding of the span of life and other such as has been kept from the occidental world 
are in this book boldly brought out. 
The Koran, Americanized as it will be, can be bought in a few weeks. It will be sent to all 
Governors of The Moorish Science Temples of America. 
From the Prophet 
NOBLE DREW ALI 
 Many people are unaware of the importance of our Prophet’s action on this 
date in 1912 here in America. Others are unclear as to the reason for our usage 
of the same flag flown by Moroccans in Africa; Briefly it must be understood 
in the year of 1912 in the  month of March as a result of actions taken by 
European countries as well as the Sultan of morocco was stripped of its right 
to rule itself. With that came the removal of the Moroccan flag, this was then 
just a plain piece of red cloth. ] This can be verified in a flag book]. In the same 
month Prophet Noble Drew Ali went to Washington DC where he met with the 
President to reclaim our flag, the all red flag with a five pointed green star in 
the center; which was taken down during the colonial times. Because of the 
Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali’s action, Moors here in America were able to 
display with pride our ancient flag during the years when Moroccans could not 
1912-1956. Therefore March 17th is recognized as Moorish Tag Day, which 
celebrates the return of the five pointed green star to our flag here on U.S. soil, 
as the Moorish flag’s return to the world via Prophet Noble Drew Ali’s Divine 
work in America. Upon its independences in March 1956, the constitutional 
monarchy of Morocco adopted the red flag with the five pointed green star in 
the center as its National symbol of freedom and self-determination.

After the traitors actions of Lomax Bey ex-Grand Governor and enemy to the Divine Creed 
and Un-loyal to the national Government U.S.A. to which the ….movement is to make men 
and women better citizens.   
“  
CHICAGO, ILL March 11, 1929 Brother Crumby-Bey the Governor and Chief Head of the 
Temple in Pittsburgh Pa. Brother Childs-Bey Governor and Chief Head of the Temple in 
Cleveland Ohio. These two Brothers are in power by the PROPHET to investigate business etc. 
of Temples number four in Detroit Michigan, because Lomax-Bey has violated all DIVINE 
LAWS of the PROPHET even before the prophet’s face, FEB. 15, 1929. He claims that the 
Prophet has no more power and the finance from Detroit would be in his charge. He wouldn’t 
send any to the Prophet.  
He Lomax Bey, with a loud voice said “Look at me! I will guide you through.” This is lawful 
and living evidence spoken before fifteen hounded (1,500) people and the Prophet was also 
present. 
“I, THE PROPHET, declare his Office vacant and the name of Grand Governor discharged. He 
can only be a member according to LAW because the Moorish Science Temple of America is a 
DIVINE ORGAINZATION. Each Temple is under Supreme Guidance of the Prophet. 
When man fails after being placed Head of the Temple by the Prophet of obeying our Divine 
laws and Constitution, he is a traitor and enemy to the Divine Creed and Un-loyal to the 
National Government U.S.A. to which the government is to make men and women better 
citizens.”

Excerpt from ‘The Moorish Guide’ Newspaper - 1929 A. D. 
‘The Moorish Guide’ enters the field of journalism with “Malice to none and charity to all”. It 
is not our purpose to disregard the Work of other splendid journals; it is not our purpose to 
fail to give due attention and space to all American citizens, individuals and organizations 
alike, who are working in their chosen fields of endeavor for the progress and development of 
all American citizens and all American Institutions. We hope to cooperate with them in the 
intensive and grueling battle for universal justice. ‘The Moorish Guide’ feels that ‘the greatest 
weapon’ in the hands of our group today in America is our press. The truth will never be told 
about a disadvantaged minority by the general press of any country, whether that minority be 
racial, political or religious. 
Unless we express ourselves through papers of our own the truth about us will not be told. 
Many of the beautiful things, many of the hopeful things and events which mark the progress 
of our group, will go unrecorded were it not for papers of our own. Our papers are our only 
hope of shoveling ourselves out from under the avalanche of lies that are annually let loose 
upon us. “A strong free press is the best possible safeguard of the liberties in general promotion 
and defense of the interests of strong, free people.” - Prophet Noble Drew ALI-

the United States is in connection with the presence of such officer or employee. 
(4)“Internationally protected person” means—

a Chief of State or the political equivalent, head of government, or Foreign Minister 
whenever such person is in a country other than his own and any member of his family 
accompanying him; or

States as an official guest of the Government of the United States pursuant to designation 
as such by the Secretary of State. 
(7) 
“National of the United States” has the meaning prescribed in 
section 101(a)(22) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(22)). 
(c) 
If the victim of an offense under subsection (a) is an internationally protected person

the victim is a representative, officer, employee, or agent of the United States, (2) an 
offender is a national of the United States, or (3) an offender is afterwards found in the 
United States. As used in this subsection, the United States includes all areas under the 
jurisdiction of the United States including any of the places within the provisions of 
sections 5 and 7 of this title and section 46501(2) of title 49. 
(d) 
In the course of enforcement of this section and any other sections prohibiting a 
conspiracy or attempt to violate this section, the Attorney General may request assistance 
from any Federal, State, or local agency, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, any 
statute, rule, or regulation to the contrary notwithstanding. 
Section 101(a)(22) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states that 
“the term ‘national of the United States’ means (A) a citizen of the United States, 
or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance 
to the United States.” Therefore, U.S. citizens are also U.S. nationals. Non-citizen 
nationality status refers only individuals who were born either in American Samoa or on 
PAGE 99 
Swains Island to parents who are not citizens of the United States.  The concept of dual 
nationality means that a person is a national of two countries at the same time. Each 
country has its own nationality laws based on its own policy. Persons may have dual 
nationality by automatic operation of different laws rather than by choice. For example, a 
child born in a foreign country to U.S. national parents may be both a U.S. national and a 
national of the country of birth. 
A U.S. national may acquire foreign nationality by marriage, or a person naturalized as a 
U.S. national may not lose the nationality of the country of birth. U.S. law does not 
mention dual nationality or require a person to choose one nationality or another. Also, a 
person who is automatically granted another nationality does not risk losing U.S. 
nationality. However, a person who acquires a foreign nationality by applying for it may 
lose U.S. nationality. In order to lose U.S. nationality, the law requires that the person 
must apply for the foreign nationality voluntarily, by free choice, and with the intention to 
give up U.S. nationality. 
Intent can be shown by the person's statements or conduct. The U.S. Government 
recognizes that dual nationality exists but does not encourage it as a matter of policy 
because of the problems it may cause. Claims of other countries on dual national U.S. 
nationals may conflict with U.S. law, and dual nationality may limit U.S. Government 
efforts to assist nationals abroad. The country where a dual national is located generally 
has a stronger claim to that person's allegiance. 
However, dual nationals owe allegiance to both the United States and the foreign country. 
They are required to obey the laws of both countries. Either country has the right to 
enforce its laws, particularly if the person later travels there. Most U.S. nationals, 
including dual nationals, must use a U.S. passport to enter and leave the United States. 
Dual nationals may also be required by the foreign country to use its passport to enter and 
leave that country. Use of the foreign passport does not endanger U.S. nationality. Most 
countries permit a person to renounce or otherwise lose nationality. 
Information on losing foreign nationality can be obtained from the foreign country's 
embassy and consulates in the United States. Americans can renounce U.S. nationality in 
the proper form at U.S. embassies and consulates abroad. 
18 U.S. Code § 112 - Protection 
of foreign officials, official 
guests, and internationally 
protected persons 
PAGE 100 
(a) 
Whoever assaults, strikes, wounds, imprisons, or offers violence to a foreign official, 
official guest, or internationally protected person or makes any other violent attack

MOORISH JURISPRUDENCE 101 
PROPHET MAKES PLEA TO NATIONS 
Friday, November 9, 1928 
Our Divine and National Movement stands for the specific grand principles of Love, Truth, 
Peace, Freedom and Justice, and I The Prophet am applying to all loyal, faithful Moors, 
members, and the American citizens to help me in my great uplifting acts of uplifting fallen 
humanity among the Asiatic race and nation, for I have suffered much and severely in the 
past through misunderstanding of what the movement was dedicated to. It is the Great God 
Allah, alone that guides the destiny of this Divine and National Movement. I know all true 
American citizens are identified by national descent name to answer and apply to the free 
national constitution of this free National Republic of the United States of America. That’s 
why I am calling on all true national citizens to help me morally and financially in my great 
work; I am going to help this national government. For without a free national name a 
decent flag of your forefathers, there is not a national divine title of the government in which 
we live. 
Prophet Noble Dew Ali 
PAGE 109 
THE PROPHET’S WARNING TO THE NATION 
FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1928 
The citizens of all free national Governments, according to their National Constitution, are 
all of one family bearing one free National name. Those who fail to recognize the free 
national name of their Constitutional government are classed as undesirables, and are 
subject to all inferior names and abuses and mistreatments that the citizens care to bestow 
upon them. And it is a sin for any group of people to violates the national Constitutional 
Laws of a free National Government; and cling to the names and principles that delude to 
slavery. 
I, the Prophet, was prepared by the Great God, Allah to warn my people to repent from their 
sinful ways, and go back to that state of mind to their forefathers’ Divine and National 
Principles- that they will be law abiders and receive their divine right as citizens according 
to the free National Constitution that was prepared for all free national beings- they are to 
claim their own free National name and religion. 
There I but one issue for the to recognize by this Government and of the earth, and that 
comes only through the connection of the Moorish Divine National Movement which is 
incorporated in this government and recognized by all others Nations of the World. And 
through it, they and their children can receive their divine rights, unmolested by other 
citizens. 
That they can cast a free National ballot to the polls under the free National Constitution of 
the United States Government, and not under a “Granted Privilege” as has been the existing 
condition for many generation. You, who doubt whether I the Prophet, and my principles 
are right for the redemption of my people, go to those That know the law in City Hall and 
among the officials in your government and ask them under intelligent tone and they will 
be glad to render you a favorable reply; for they are glad to see me bring you out of the 
darkness into light. 
PAGE 110 
Money doesn’t make the man; it is free national standards and power that make a man and 
a nation. The wealth of all National Governments, gold and silver, commerce, belongs to 
the citizen alone; and without your national citizenship by name and principle, you have no 
true wealth. And I am hereby calling on all true citizens that stand for a National Free 
Government and the enforcement of the Constitution to help me in my great missionary 
work, because I need all support from all true American citizens of the United States of 
America. Help me to save my people, who have fallen from the Constitutional laws of this 
government. I am depending on your support to get them back to the Constitutional fold 
again, that they will learn to love-instead of hate and will live according to Love, Truth, 
Peace, Freedom and Justice, supporting our free National Constitution of the United States 
of America. 
I love my people, and I desire their Unity and mine back to their own free national and 
Divine Standard, because day by day they have been violating the national and 
Constitutional Laws of their government by claiming names and principles that are 
unconstitutional. If Italians, Greeks, English, Chinese, Turks, and Arabians are forced to 
proclaim their free national name and religion before the Constitutional Government of the 
United States of America, it is no more than right that the law should be forced upon all 
American citizens alike. In all other governments, when a man is born and raised there and 
asked his name of national descent and name if he fails to give it he is misused, imprisoned, 
exiled. Any group of people who fail to answer up to the Constitutional Standards of Law 
by name and principle, because to be a citizen of any government you must claim your 
National name descent. Because they place their trust upon issue and names that they are 
not a part and partial of, and neither were they formed by their forefathers  The word “Negro” 
deludes in Latin language to thee word “nigger”; the same the word “colored” deludes to 
anything that is painted, varnished, and dyed. And every nation must bear a national 
descent name of their fore-fathers, because honoring thy fathers and thy mothers, your days 
will be lengthened upon the earth. These names have never been recognized by any true 
American citizen of this day. 
Through your free National name, you are known and recognized by all nations of the earth 
that are recognized by said National government in which they live. The 14th and 15th 
PAGE 111 
amendments brought the North and in unity; placing the Southerners, which was at that 
time without power, with the Constitutional Body of Power. And at that time, 1865, the free 
National Constitutional Law that was enforced since 1774 declared by the Free National 
Constitution has never been changed, there is no need for the application of the 1th and 15th 
amendment for the Salvation of our people and citizens. 
So, there isn’t but one supreme issue for my people to use to redeem that which was lost, 
and that is through the above statement. Them the lion and lamb can lie down in yonder 
hills and neither will be harmed; because Lobe, Truth, Peace, Freedom and Justice will be 
reigning in this land. In those days the United States will be one of the greatest civilized and 
prosperous governments of the world, but if the above principles are not carried out by the 
citizens and my people in this government, the worst is yet to come, because the Great God 
of the Universe is not pleased with the works that are being performed in North America by 
my people, and this great sin must be removed from the land to save it from enormous 
earthquakes, diseases, etc. 
And I, the prophet, do hereby believe that this administration of the government being 
more wisely prepared by more genius citizens that believe in their free National 
Constitution and Laws and through the help of such classes of citizens, I the Prophet, truly 
believe that my people will find the true and dive way of their forefathers, and learn to stop 
serving carnal customs and merely ideas of man, that have never done them any good- but 
has always harmed them.  
So I, the prophet, am hereby calling aloud, with a divine plea, to all true American citizens, 
to help me remove this great sin which has been committed and is being practiced by my 
people in the United States of America; because they know it is not the true and divine way, 
and without understanding they have fallen from the true light into utter darkness of sin, 
and there is not a nation on earth today that will recognize them socially, religiously 
politically, economically, etc, in their present condition of endevorment, in which they 
themselves try to force upon a civilized world. They will not reframe from their sinful ways 
of action and their deeds have brought “Jim-Crowism”, segregation and everything that 
brings harm to a human being on earth. And they fought the Southerners for all these great 
misuses, but I have traveled in the South and have examined conditions there, and it is the 
PAGE 112 
work of my people continuously practicing the things which bring dishonor, disgrace, and 
disrespect to any notion that lives the life. And I am hereby calling on all true American 
citizens for moral support and finance to help me in my great missionary work to bring my 
people out of darkness into the marvelous light. 
From THE PROPHET 
The Voice of the Prophet 
If you have race pride and love your race, join the Moorish Science Temple of America and 
become a part of this Divine Movement. Then you will have power to redeem your race 
because you will know who you are and your forefathers were. Because where there is unity, 
there is strength. : “Together we stand, divided we fall.” 
Come, good people, because I, the Prophet, sent to redeem this nation from mental slavery, 
which you have now, need every one of you who think your condition can be better. This is 
a field held open men to strong men and women to uplift the nation and take your place in 
the affairs of men. 
If the European and other nations are helping me, why not you? It is your problem. The 
Negro problem is being solved only as it can, and that is by the Moorish Divine Movement. 
If you have a nation, you must have a free national name in order to be recognized by this 
nation as an American citizen. This is what was meant when it was said “Seek ye first the 
Kingdom of Heaven and all these things would be added unto you.” 
By the Prophet 
Prophet Warns All Moslems 
GOVERNORS ORDER TO READ PROCLAMATION AT EACH MEETING 
I hereby inform all members that they must end all radical agitating speeches while at work, 
in their homes or on the street. We are for Peace and not destruction. Stop flashing your 
cards at Europeans, it causes confusion. Remember your card is for your salvation. Failure 
to obey these orders will be of server consequence. We are for Love, Truth, Peace, and 
PAGE 113 
Freedom and when these principles are violated, Justice must take its course. Any member 
or group of members who hold malicious feelings towards the Temple or the Prophet, or 
violate the divine covenant of the Moorish Movement, will receive their reward from Allah 
for their unjust deeds. All true Moors will and must obey the Law as laid down to them by 
their Prophet. If they lose confidence in their Prophet they should turn in their card, button, 
cease wearing their Turban or Fez and return to the state where I, the Prophet, found you. 
This is a Holy and Divine Movement founded by the Prophet, Noble Drew Ali, and if the 
Prophet is not right the  
Temple is not right. The Prophet therefore is sending out a Divine plea to all Moorish 
Americans that they do their part in protecting their Prophet and the Temple. This is an 
everlasting movement founded by the Prophet through the will of Allah to redeem his 
people from their sins.

The Divine Constitution and By-Laws 
Act 1. The Grand Sheik and the chairman of the Moorish Science Temple of America is in 
power to make law and enforce law with the assistance of the prophet and the Grand Body 
of the Moorish Science temple of America. The Assistant Grand Sheik is to assist the Grand 
Sheik in all affairs if he lives according to Love, Truth, peace, Freedom and Justice, and it is 
known before the members of the Moorish Science Temple of America.  
Act 2. All meeting are to open and closed promptly according to the circle seven and Love, 
Truth, peace, Freedom and Justice, because Friday is our Holy day of rest because the first 
man was formed in flesh and the first man departed out of flesh and ascended onto his 
father God Allah, for that cause Friday is the Holy day for all Moslems all over the world. 
Act 3. Love Truth Peace, Freedom and Justice must be proclaimed and practice by all 
members of the Moorish Science Temple of America. No member is to accuse falsely his 
brother or sister on any occasion at all that may harm is brother or sister Because Allah is 
Love. 
Act 4. All Members must preserve these holy and Divine Laws and all members must obey 
the laws of the government because by being a Moorish American you are part and partial 
of the government and must live the life accordingly. 
Act 5. This organization of the Moorish Science Temple of America is not to cause confusion 
or over through the laws of this constitution of said government but to obey herby. 
Act 6. With us all members must proclaim their nationality and we are teaching our people 
their nationality and divine creed that they may know that they are a part and partial of this 
said government, and know that they are not Negros, Colored Folks or Black People or 
Ethiopians, because these names were given to slaves in 1774 and lasted until 1886 during 
the times if slavery; but this is a new era of time now and all men now must proclaim their 
free national name to be recognized by the government in which they live and the nations 
of the earth; this is the reason why Allah the great God of the universe ordained Noble Drew 
Ali the prophet to redeem his people from their sinfully ways. The Moorish Americans are 
the descendants of the ancient Moabites whom inhabited the North Western and South 
Western shores of Africa. 
PAGE 122 
Act 7. All members must promptly attend their meeting and become a part and partial of 
all uplifting acts of the Moorish Science Temple of America; then you are entitled to the

and daughters must obey father and mother and become industrious and become a part of 
uplifting fallen humanity. All Moorish Americans must keep their hearts and minds pure

Allah’s Holy Prophet told E. Mealy El our first Supreme Grand Sheik appointed by the 
Prophet himself. ‘The Prophet told me dear Moslems.’ “I have put my law in your hand and 
my word in your mouth, and you are to tell them what to do, and they are to obey. 
Tell them my law hold up me before them. If you will hold me up before them, I will 
draw all men unto me.”  [RE: E. Mealy El’s state documents (see Moorish American Scholar 
Hist. fact on E. Mealy El 1929-1934)] 
The facts are: ‘There is only One Prophet and One Temple’; then why do we have all these 
sets and splinter groups calling themselves Moorish Science Temple of America etc.? It is 
obvious through observation and application that theses splinter groups do not know where 
the authority lies. We conclude that this is due to the lack of scientific study on the subject 
matter of Nationality, which our Prophet Noble Drew Ali said ‘is the order of the day’.   
There are too many belief systems with no facts to determine a right understanding, thus 
bringing about a misunderstanding of what the Holy Prophet established, and an idea that 
the Prophet did not fully establish all it takes to save us here in North America.  And this 
brings about a falsehood,(because of his demonstration from  1913-1929) and the mere ideas 
of man become paramount, in looking for redemption out of the state of being a 2nd class 
citizen, a corporation, statutory citizen, and debtor, person, Black, Colored Person, a Negro 
or African American, Latino, Hispanic ,Filipinos etc . 
In addition, the lower self-perpetuates this illusionary state of thinking.  ‘I can do 
my own thing, or thinking you can take a little of this Moorish Science (using the name Bey 
or El or the old Temple names established by the Prophet) and go out and do you with it. 
PAGE 124 
Startup little sects, clubs, 501(c) 3 corporations’ and call it a Temple.it Moorish Science this 
or that, so you can be the Man, get recognized, or play the hero.  You cannot do your own 
thing! 
HERE IS WHY. Primarily doing YOUR own thing is not what Allah’s Holy Prophet Noble 
Drew Ali established. When he came back he knew you had [and now have] mental slavery, 
caused from a European Psychology, that stagnated your progress, no knowledge of self, 
and therefore will remain a slave to everybody else.  Noble Drew Ali was not even doing his 
thing; being Allah’s holy prophet he was sent to bring us the everlasting gospel of Allah, 
(KQMA #40) and save us from the wrath of Allah, that awful day which is sure to come. 
Moreover, he did just that, and left his foot prints clearly cut for those of us to see which 
way he went. He kept the political complex answer to our collective problem wrapped up 
in the term ‘Nationality’ and secured it under Religion (check mate!!) for our in-depth 
research and made it the order of the day to show its priority for us to understand. 
NATIONALITY THE ORDER OF THE DAY 
Why is Nationality the order of the day? Has anyone ever answered or asked that question 
to their Sheik or better yet yourself? Good. 
The Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali and his divine Ministers of his cabinet gave out calling 
cards to the Asiatics of North America, which told us to… “Come all ye Asiastics and learn 
the Truth about your Nationality and Birthrights, because you are not colored, etc. And you 
must claim a free national name to be an American citizen…” Did you get your divine calling? 
This was the first document that one got from the Prophet or Sheik. If one would have read 
their calling, card and define the subject matter ‘nationality’ a lot of one’s own doubts would 
stop. 
PAGE 125 
“The time has come when every nation must worship under its own vine and fig 
tree” (MHK XLVII: 15) 
NATIONALITY 
[BLK’sLaw6th] Nationality: “that quality or character which arise from the fact of a person’s 
belonging to a nation or state. Nationality determines the political status especially with 
reference to allegiance; while domicile determines his civil status. Nationality arises ether by 
birth or naturalization.”   Nationality affords the state jurisdiction over the person and 
affords the person the protection of the state. The two most important parts of this particular 
definition to understand from a scientific eye is domicile and thee most important from 
these two are political status. 
Some facts about Nationality: 1.1 is a political status, 1.2 is defined by the Constitution, which 
is a political document. 1.3 Is synonymous with being a ‘national’ within statutory law. 1.4. 
Gives one the right to political association. 1.5 Gives one constitutional citizenship. 1.6 Is 
associated with a specific country. 1.7 Is called a ‘political citizen’ or a citizen of the United 
States in a political sense, by the courts to distinguish it from a STATUTORY citizen. See 
Powel v United States, 109 F.2d 147 (1940), Nationality therefore is the principle relationship 
that connects an individual to a state. Let us Look a Political Status and begin to connect 
the dots.  [BLK 6th p.1158] Political: pertaining or relating to the policy or the administration 
of government, state or national. Pertaining to or incidental to, the exercise of the functions 
vested in those charged with the conduct of government; of or pertaining to exercise of 
rights and privileges or the influence by which individuals of a state seek to determine or 
control its public policy; having to do with organization or action of individual parties. 
Political status gives one Political Rights.  Political Rights are those, which may be exercised 
in the formation or administration of the government. Rights of a citizen established or 
recognized by constitution (Act 6.) which gives them the power to participate directly or 
indirectly in the establishment or administration of government. The Holy Prophet was 
reported as saying, “I’m going to leave the European here just long enough to teach 
you how to run a government.” In addition, it all starts with understanding nationality. 
PAGE 126 
Nationality gives one Political Right’s within those political rights is the right of association 
to associate with your political community; the right to freedom of association and freedom 
from compelled association, (first Amendment to the Constitution). Association is the 
freedom to choose; choose  a domicile,(“…let the bonds of affection, therefore unite thee 
with thy brothers, that peace and happiness may dwell in thy father’s house and when 
ye separate in the world, remember the relation that bindeth you to love and unity; 
and prefer not a stranger before thy own blood.” HKofMSTofA XXV: 2-3) it is 
voluntarily entered into. Please at this stage pay very close attention….When you choose 
your associations (political community) which is determined by your ‘Domicile’  you have 
chosen your Civil Status  or Legal status. At this stage if one has proclaimed his nationality 
with the lawful government aka The Moorish Science Temple of America; Home Office of 
Noble Drew Ali, Chicago, Il USA and its lawful branch temples (Act 1. Additional Laws) and 
“…proclaimed their (your) free national name in the government in which you live and the 
nations of the earth…” you are a ‘National’… (We the People) well that is yet to be 
determined. Let us define a few more terms before we move on. Domicile: a person’s legal 
home. That place where a man has his true fixed, and permanent home and principal 
establishment, and to which whenever he is absent has the intention of returning. Smith v. 
Smith 206 Pa.Super.310, 213 A.2d 94. Generally. Physical presence within a state and the 
intention to make it one’s home are the request of establishing a ‘domicile’ therein. A person 
may have more than one residence but only one domicile. 
The legal domicile of a person is important since it rather than the actual resident 
often controls the jurisdiction of the taxing authorities and determines where a person may 
exercise the privileges/rights of voting and other legal rights and immunities. (Speaking on 
taxes for all you who are reluctant about taxes ...Being domicile and not nationality is what 
imputes a status under the tax code and a liability for tax. Tax liability is civil liability that 
attaches to civil statutory law, which attaches to a ‘person’ through their choice of domicile. 
{Your Per-Capita Tax Card is very important. To be able to prove you pay taxes to your 
lawful Civil government were your domiciled at,} (Those with eyes to see and ears to hear 
should be tuning in about their tax situation...Ask you are self-can they tax a Religious Body 
Politic. What about an agent [missionary] from that Body politic? [See 1099 form; ‘Our 
Authority’]) No one can force you to acquire or retain a domicile anywhere, including within 
PAGE 127 
the federal zone or to accept the civil status that attaches to it of statutory citizen (14th 
Amendment citizen) or resident. It is voluntary. Domicile determines your Civil and Legal 
and Statutory status. It does not determine your Political status or Nationality. Civil 
Status or Legal status: (Civil: originally pertaining to or appropriate to a member of a 
civitas or free political community; natural or proper to a citizen {National}. Also, relating 
to the community, or to the policy and government of the citizen and subject of a state.) 
Civil Status: gives you 1. The ability to contract with other parties including the 
government. 2. Politically and legally associate with groups you choose to associate with. 
*3. Choose or nominate the civil government that you want to protect your rights to life 
liberty and property...this is where your jury of peers is established, etc.3.1 choosing a 
domicile is an act of political association that has legal consequences in which you nominate 
a specific municipal government to protect your rights and property.[In others word the 
local governmental  laws that will govern you]  This is why the Declaration of Independence 
says that all just powers of government are derived from the consent of the people. Those 
who do not concede to a civil municipality have no civil protection or real Civil Rights you 
would be automatically   presumed to have a statutory citizenship status [14th Amendment 
citizen see Civiliter Mortuus or Civil Death]. Domicile is how you exercise rights 2 and 3. 
You can choose where your domicile is and you can change it at any time. 
When you choose a domicile, you elect or nominate a protector, which in turn gives 
rise to an obligation to pay for the civil protection demanded. The method of providing that 
protection is the civil laws of the municipal (as in county [Branch Temple]) jurisdiction that 
you chose a domicile within; ( Divine Constitution and By-Laws, Additional Laws, the 
Koran, General Laws, Supreme Laws, Rules, and Regulations, of the Prophet are the civil 
laws of the  Religious government (MSTof A))…Now what does it all mean? Well when one 
proclaims a Nationality their Political Status {political rights} is established (‘National’ of 
the United States of America,  Moorish American) giving you the choice to associate with a 
political community(Grand Temple, Grand Major Temples, Branch Temples) to establish 
your Civil Status/Legal Status your laws that will govern you. By your choice of 
Domicile ;( Home Office of Noble Drew Ali Chicago, Il) thus creating the political or 
constitutional and civil status of a human being. A  National a true American citizen of the 
United States of America the Republic. A Moorish American!  We The People,  
PAGE 128 
Let us go a little further. Nationality gives you your citizenship as a national, a 
constitutional citizen. Citizens are members of a political community who in their 
associated capacity, have established or submitted themselves to the dominion of a 
government. {The Religious Body Politic aka Moorish Science Temple of America.} By giving 
up some of their natural rights for the promotion of their general welfare and the protection 
of their individual as well as collective rights. Herriot v City of Seattle 81 Wash. 2d 48 500 P 
2nd 101, 109.  Citizen one who under the Constitution and laws of the United States of 
America or of a particular state, is a member of the political community owing  allegiance 
(allegiance is associated with Nationality allegiance is what makes one a citizen/subject of 
a country.)  And being entitled to the enjoyments of full Civil Rights. One’s full Civil Rights 
are enforced through municipal civil law, which in turn can only attach to ones choice of 
legal domicile. 
Now for those who believe that being a Private Individual or alien national is going 
to protect you because you got this status by way of paper work/ucc etc... You are the 
executor of such n such estate you have copied right to your name, you are power of attorney 
etc., etc., etc..  (You may be getting small reprievable remedies for now but).  When private 
individuals of one nation (states of the union) spread themselves through another as 
business or caprice may direct, mingling indiscriminately with the inhabitants of that other 
or when merchant vessels enter for the purpose of trade it would be inconvenient and 
dangerous to  society, and would subject the law to continuous infractions… if such 
Individual or merchant did not owe temporary and local allegiance and were not amenable 
to the jurisdiction of the country… the implied license, therefore under which They enter 
can never be construed to grant such exemption 7 Cranch 144. “…the implied license under 
which private individuals of another nation enter the territory and mingle indiscriminately 
with its inhabitants for purpose of business or pleasure can never be construed to grant to 
them an exemption from the jurisdiction of the country in which they are found. See also 
Carlisle v U.S. (1872)16 Wall. 147, 155 Radich v Hutchins (1877) 95 U.S. 210. 
So even if you have done all that paper work and think yourself untouchable…WAM
BAM ‘applied license’ all because you failed to see that The Moorish Science Temple of 
America (the correct one…there is but One) is the only soul foundation where the Asiatic 
PAGE 129 
of North America will find his/her salvation under! ..Now just because you failed to see does 
not mean defeat. You must be domiciled in your Political Community; a branch temple of 
the MSTof A (Act 1 Additional Laws) which is attached to The One Temple your domicile.  
All the fancy names, The Great Amexem such and such these great so called Orders 
of this and that all these sects and clubs, and 501(c) 3’s with Moorish this and that as your 
name. Your heart may be right looking for the salvation established by the Prophet Noble 
Drew Ali but your association is wrong. The facts are if you are not domiciled in your own 
municipality as a constitutional citizen; then no matter what you do. And this could be hard 
for some to swallow…You are subject to the civil laws that you were born (formed) in; and 
the only civil laws attached to a Negro is statutory civil laws of  a 14th Amendment citizen. 
Most Moors today have a birth certificate with the misnomer Negro as the 
nationality. Your birth certificates acts as your place of resident  (being over 18 legal age to 
consent  you freely made a choice to stay as a resident on record and registered , by way of 
your birth certificate in a federal zone)  that determines your civil laws that will govern you.  
All must see were the authority lies, and that’s with the Holy Prophet Noble Drew 
Ali sent from Allah to saves us from the wrath of Allah, period! The Prophets One Temple; 
known as the Moorish Science Temple of America. That is why he put his face on the 
documents. He is the seal, on the charter; he is the Moorish Science Temple of America and 
you cannot separate the two. Plus he had to put his face on the documents so we would 
know the real one, he is a prophet he saw all this coming… and even after he put his seal on 
all official records Laws, Regulations, Rules Organic Law, Koran (ecclesiastical and Secular 
laws) etc. still some choose to follow the so-called  reincarnated so-called Prophet. The  C. 
Kirckman Bey, Lomax Bey, the Dingel El’s, W.Frad Muhammad, German Bey, C. M. Bey etc. 
etc. etc.   And these are the facts. So you have today brothers and sisters thinking they can 
do, they own thing without the Prophet and his lawful succession. It’s not enough to just 
put his name in your documents, on web sites, have a bey or el attached to your acquired 
last name without properly; being part and parcel via-your Per Capita Tax Card, Dues card, 
Nationality and Identification Card for the Moorish Science Temple of America etc..  (And 
Birthrights for the Moorish Americans.) In the correct Temple.  Your Dues Card establishes 
your years in the Temple in your local municipal government by way of No. of Temple on 
the card and Domicile at Home office.  Per Capita Tax Card show you are paying tax to you

jurisdiction and numerates you as parcel and establish jurisdiction to your Body Politic. 
Study your Nationality and Identification Card it is all there too.   
RE: The Prophet‘s Warning To The Nations Friday, March 1, 1928; “Money (Notes) 
does not make the man; it is free national standards (Lawful Rights) and power 
(establish your own municipal government; (district Temple MSTA 43), the prophet 
left no stone unturned) that make a man and nation. The wealth of all National 
Governments, gold, silver (what creditor deal in), commerce, (Uniform Commercial 
Code) belongs to the citizen alone; and without your national citizenship by name 
and principle, (the holy and divine laws) you have no true wealth…” (Emphasis added).  
Question; when has a Negro ever been a citizen of the USA; I will tell you NEVER! 
(See Dread Scott case 1864) So what gives him/her the right to act as a citizen (1st class) in 
commerce? Doing business as a National (one who holds the credit of the nation)? Also 
clamming to be sovereign you went from a Negro to sovereign- oooBoy how you do that? 
By way of commerce? Ucc?  Were you had to be a true citizen to fully use that body of law… 
sounds fishy. Remember money does not make a man, money an interments used in 
commerce; its free national standards that make a man. A ‘Man’ you were 3/5 a man; free 
national standards are (Nationality and Divine Creed the two parts that were missing from 
your status to make you a Man/Human.)  Let us move on and conclude this academic.

National can also be described as a “citizen” when he/she is domiciled within the territorial 
and legislative jurisdiction of the Political Body to which one claims allegiance, being a 
‘National” is therefore an attribute and a prerequisite of being a citizen and the term can be 
used to describe ‘citizen.” 
“Any group of people who fail to answer up to the Constitutional Standards 
of Law by name and principle, (Surname and Law) because to be a citizen of any 
government you must claim your national name and descent.”

repent from their sinful ways, and go back to the state of mind of their forefathers’ 
divine and National Principles-that they will be law abiders and receive their divine 
rights as citizens according to the free national Constitution that was prepared for 
all free national beings, they are to claim their own free national name and religion. 
There is but one issue for the to be recognized by this Government (USA) and of the 
earth and that comes ONLY THROUGH the connection (in association with) of the 
Moorish Divine National Movement, which is incorporated in this government and 
recognized by all other Nations (States of the union also) of the world. And through 
it, they and their children can receive their divine rights (Political Rights, Real Civil

RFRA (Religious freedom and restoration Act) The supreme Court had found

“Courts may not decide matters of church doctrine or governance.”(Cf. Kedroff v St. 
Nicholas Cathedral, 344 U.S. 94,116 (1952)) 
U.S. v Ballard (1944) The Courts found that neither neither the courts nor the government 
have the right to evaluate the religious beliefs of a citizen or group.  
*Waston v Jones, 80 U.S. (13 Wall) Courts may not interfere in matters of church doctrine, 
discipline or policy.  
[T]he First Amendment rest upon the premise that both religion and government can best 
work to achieve their lofty aims if each is left free from the other within it-respected sphere.

Missionaries Man or Woman piece it together can you not see your earthly and divine 
salvation the Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali establish for us. Keep the Prophet out in front, 
because his was tried and true. It stands as a fact today!! And all this above come by way of 
your nationality, better yet you truly understanding Your Nationality.  
In conclusion  
I hope this academic brings Moor light to the importance of ‘KEEPING THE 
PROPHET OUT IN FRONT’ the jurisprudence thereof. My intention was not to offend any 
organization or group. We need not chase after the gods of Europe and mere ideas of man 
to save ourselves.  Allah’s holy Prophet got us! And that’s a fact! Some might need to as I 
did; to smash the [N]eg[r]o, (ego) and humble themselves and  
“Say not unto thyself, “Behold, truth breedeth hatred, and I will avoid it; 
dissimulation (to disguise ones intentions under a feigned appearance) raisheth 
friends, and I will follow it.” Are not the enemies, made by truth better than friends 
obtained by flattery?”  HKofMSTofA XLIII: 18

The Science of US legal history & the 14th 
Amendment Slave Ship 101 
U.S. Law is Private Merchant Law, leaving the people as Surety and Debtor on the 
bankruptcy.  
Law is contract, universally and in the U.S., so we must follow the progression of 
contractual agreements which constitute the underlying U.S. Law. (We cannot address all 
individual laws and cases or you would not have time in a life to review it, even though 
ignorance of the millions of laws, statutes, codes, etc… is no excuse in Private Admiralty 
Jurisdictions.)  
In basically chronological order, the following progression of contracts, and our 
interpretation of them follows:  
1. 
The USA, a corporation of the English Crown, is bankrupt, and has been since at 
least 1788.  The Articles of Confederation states in Article 12: “All bills of credit emitted, 
monies borrowed, and debts contracted by, or under the authority of Congress, before the 
assembling of the United States, in pursuance of the present confederation, shall be 
deemed as considered a charge against the United States, for payment and satisfaction 
whereof the said United States, and the public faith are hereby solemnly pledged.”  The 
“Founding Fathers,” as constitutors, acknowledged and reorganized the debt in the US 
Constitution  
1787, Article VI, hence “constitution.”  Bankruptcy occurred on January 1, 1788 based on 21 
loans that the  
United States of America received from the King of England dating from February 28, 1778 
through July 5, 1782, the repayment of which had been ratified by Congress on January 22, 
1783.  The United States Bank, created in 1791, was a private bank, with 18,000 of 25,000 
shares owned by England.  
PAGE 136 
2. 
No de jure, constitutional Congress has existed since March 27, 1861 when seven (7) 
Southern States walked out of Congress leaving Congress without a quorum for adjourning 
and therefore ending sine die.  That which is called “Congress” today assembles and acts 
under the authority of the President acting in capacity of being Commander-In-Chief of 
the Armed Forces, under emergency war-powers rule, i.e. “law of necessity,” (see 12 Stat 
319, which has never been repealed and exists in Title 50 USC §§ 212, 213, 215, Appendix 16, 
26 CFR Chapter 1 § 303.1-6(a), and 31 CFR Chapter 5 § 500.701 Penalties).   
3. 
Since the above-referenced date, March 27, 1861, Americans have been under 
executive rule via presidential executive order under the aforementioned Emergency War 
Powers, 12 USC 95 a,  
b. Every “citizen of the United States” is now “legally” established as an “enemy” via 
the Amendatory Act of March 9, 1933, 48 Stat. 1, amending Trading with Enemy Act of 
October 6, 1917, H.R. 4960, Public Law No. 91.  
4.    
December 6th, 1865, the 14th Amendment was proclaimed as ratified (even 
though it never properly was, see below).  The 14th Amendment, (which is private Roman 
Catholic Ecclesiastical Trust Law), constitutes a constructive, cestui que trust, a public 
charitable trust, “PCT,” that was expressly designed to bring every corporate franchise 
artificial person called a “citizen of the United States” into an inseparable merging with the 
government until the two are united (with the power inhering in the government, not the 
people).  A cestui que trust is fundamentally different from a regular trust, which is express 
in nature and consists of a contractual indenture involving three (3) parties: Grantor 
(Creator or Trustor {Prophet}), Trustee, {Sheiks} and Beneficiaries.{Members}  In an 
express trust,{fee-simple estate} legal ownership is transferred by written contract between 
Grantor and Trustee{Koran, Koran Questions for Moorish Americans, DC&By-Laws} in 
which the Grantor surrenders ownership of property to the legal person{Moorish 
American, Heir}, the Trust, to be managed by the Trustee on behalf of those who are to 
benefit from the arrangement, the Beneficiaries.  A cestui que trust, on the other hand, 
differs from an express trust in several crucial ways:  
a. 
It is not formed by express contract, i.e. overt agreement expressed in writing, but 
by legal construction.   
PAGE 137 
b. 
A cestui que trust has no Grantor, but, being a constructive trust created by 
operation of law, i.e., has only co-trustees and co‑beneficiaries.  The co-trustees are the 
parties with the duties for managing property for the “public good,” i.e. for the benefit of 
those designated as co‑beneficiaries.  
5.    The Legislative Act of February 21, 1871, Forty-first Congress, Session III, Chapter 
62, page 419, chartered a Federal company entitled “United States,” a/k/a “US Inc.,” a 
“Commercial Agency” originally designated as “Washington, D.C.,” in accordance with the 
so-called 14th Amendment, which the record indicates was never ratified (see Utah 
Supreme Court Cases, Dyett v Turner, (1968) 439 P2d 266, 267; State v Phillips, (1975) 540 
P 2d 936; as well as Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 448, 59 S. Ct. 972; 28 Tulane Law  
Review, 22; 11 South Carolina Law Quarterly 484; Congressional Record, June 13, 1967, pp. 
15641-15646).   
A “citizen of the United States” is a civilly dead entity operating as a co-trustee and co
beneficiary of the PCT, the constructive, cestui que trust of US Inc. under the 14th 
Amendment, which upholds the debt of the USA and US Inc. in Section 4.   
6. In conformity with the above-referenced creation of United States (1871) and the 14th 
Amendment, the Legislature of each State created a limited-liability corporation, 
chartered in a private, military, international, commercial, admiralty/maritime 
jurisdiction, entitled “STATE OF…” e.g. “STATE OF CALIFORNIA,” as evidenced by, 
inter alia, the change in the seal and the creation of a new constitution, e.g. 
Constitution of the State of California (1879), concerning which, re California:  
a. A general partnership agreement, hereinafter “General Partnership,” exists 
between the California Republic (1849), and STATE OF CALIFORNIA (1879), 
with STATE OF CALIFORNIA acting as governmental controller.  
b. STATE OF CALIFORNIA now acts as an agent/instrumentality of United States, 
collecting whole life insurance premiums, known as “taxes,” for the International 
Monetary Fund, based, inter alia, upon the Limited Liability Act of 1851 and the 
bankruptcy of United States of 1933, (see House Joint Resolution 192 of June 5, 
1933; Public Law 73-10; Perry v. U.S. (1935), 294 U.S. 330-381, 79 L Ed 912; 31 USC 
5112, 5119).  
PAGE 138 
7. Inasmuch as all law is contract, the contract involved in a constructive trust is an 
implied contract.   
An implied contract can be ratified by two (2) means:  
a. Acquiescence by silence, i.e. the “government” asserts its intentions concerning 
your life, rights, and property and you assent, don’t rebut, and compliantly go 
along with what they claim.  In 1871 the Government changed the nature of its 
contract with the people from law as defined by the original Constitution of 1787 
that recognizes law (common law), admiralty (on the sea only), and equity 
(functioning by voluntary contract between all participating parties), and began 
relating to people as if they were “citizens of the Unites States” within/under the 
private, commercial, international, military jurisdiction of the new de facto 
corporation, i.e. US Inc.  They offered people a “new deal,” and almost everyone 
bought it (based on naïve and foolish trust and assuming that everything was 
OK).  
The people were thereby denied access to law and placed on the ship of state of 
US Inc. where the captain’s word is law and no one has any rights.  As Jefferson phrased 
the matter, “As government grows, liberty recedes.”  
b. You expressly accept “benefits” offered by the government, and thereby finalize 
the contract by deed.  This is similar to finalizing a contract with a restaurant by 
sitting down at a table, reading a menu, and then ordering and consuming a 
meal.  By your deeds you affirm to the restaurant that you will pay for the meal 
in accordance with the price stated on the menu.  No written contract is signed, 
but a contract is formed nevertheless.   
8. By the above two (2) means people give implied assent that they are bound by an 
alleged contract with US Inc. in accordance with the terms and conditions that inhere 
in being treated as a “citizen of the United States” under the 14th Amendment, and are 
therefore placed into permanent legal status as a Debtor and Surety for U.S. Inc..  In 
such a position, people leave the ground of sovereignty and all capacity for asserting 
their unalienable rights in favor of being presumed as having exercised their 
sovereignty and free-will autonomy for the purpose of going along with the 
PAGE 139 
government’s assertion that they sacrifice everything for the “public good,” (i.e. the 
PCT).  By so doing people lose their standing in law, (i.e. they “die a civil death in the 
law.”)  They are placed in the legal position of mortmain (i.e. as if deceased) and are 
shorn of capacity for asserting their rights, since the presumption is that they have 
already exercised those rights for the purpose of being placed in the position they are 
in, i.e. property of the government with a lien against you and everything your life labor 
could ever create, including your children.  The private being (the real individual) is 
sacrificed for the good of the public (the imaginary collective).  
9. When people die such a civil death (i.e. Black people, African Americans, Latinos etc.) 
in the law they are like ghosts, and thereby incapable of managing their own affairs and 
enjoying their unalienable rights.  Like the estate of a decedent, they are then managed 
by the executors/administrators of the estate, in probate.  Such is the condition of every 
“citizen of the United States” today in law, managed by the government agencies acting 
as executors/administrators of their estates in bankruptcy, legal incapacity, and civil 
death as assets of the bankrupt US.  The US is property of the private Real Parties of 
Interest, the Creditors in bankruptcy.  
10. The 14th Amendment was allegedly established for the purpose of creating a citizenship 
for the liberated blacks (so-called), and other disenfranchised people, who otherwise 
had no citizenship because they could not comply with the requirements for state 
citizenship. (i.e. Nationality, and Divine Creed{ Also they have no state government 
which comes from  ones nation; in other words ones origins. With no state they are in 
effect stateless persons there is no one there to protect their rights as a human being, 
etc.)  What actually happened was that the blacks were taken off of the Southern slave 
plantations and placed into the slave plantation of US Inc., a far worse lot.  The 
government then gradually absorbed everyone else — including state citizens — into 
the same condition.  
.  The conspiratorial nature of matters is exemplified in comments by one of the major 
actors in the triumph of the Federal Reserve, Edward Mandell House, who had this to say 
in a private meeting with President Woodrow Wilson:  
PAGE 140 
“[Very] soon, every American will be required to register their biological property in a 
national system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient 
system of pledging.  By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, 
which will affect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency.  Every American 
will be forced to register or suffer being able to work and earn a living.  They will be our 
chattel, and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation of the law 
merchant under the scheme of secured transactions.  Americans, by unknowingly or 
unwittingly delivering the bills of lading to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent, forever 
to remain economic slaves through taxation, secured by their pledges.  They will be stripped 
of their rights and given a commercial value designed to make us a profit and they will be 
none the wiser, for not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and, if by accident 
one or two should figure it out, we have in our arsenal plausible deniability.  After all, this is 
the only logical way to fund government, by floating liens and debt to the registrants in the 
form of benefits and privileges.  This will inevitably reap to us huge profits beyond our wildest 
expectations and leave every American a contributor to this fraud which we will call “Social 
Insurance.”  Without realizing it, every American will insure us for any loss we may incur 
and in this manner, every American will unknowingly be our servant, however begrudgingly.  
The people will become helpless and without any hope for their redemption and, we will 
employ the high office of the President of our dummy corporation to foment this plot against 
America.”

traditional definition of international law, a state had to be sovereign: It needed a 
territory, a population, a government, and the ability 
to engage in diplomatic or foreign relations.}.  ]      
2. As to the person who compose the 
body politic (Members) they take collectively the name, of people, or nation (Moorish 
American, Bey or El= nationality, free national name and descent name=family name or Sur 
name (Title)); and individually they are citizens, when considered in relation to their political 
rights [Nationality], and subjects as being submitted to the laws of the state [Moorish Science 
Temple of America]. BLK4th edition: Body Politic: a nation or state; the People of a nation 
or Society considered as an organized group of citizens.  
Another important distinction needs to be made: The help the Prophet gave to the 
national government was legitimacy. Before the Prophet  
Drew Ali’s great work, the United States was not considered to be a nation in the sense of 
international law and was ruled on by the Supreme Court in 1794 in the case of Chrisholm v. 
Georgia, 2 Dall. (U.S.) 419, 1 L. Ed. 440 (1793). United States the country is a ‘society’ and 
‘sovereignty’ but not a “nation” under the laws of nations by the supreme courts own 
admission. Thus we became a true nation under God when the prophet wrapped the Moorish 
Flag around the little Moorish girl and the American Flag around the little Moorish boy at the 
Convention of 1928. “…I made you a nation within a nation the wheel within the wheel…” 
Prophet Drew Ali. Thus the Moorish Science Temple of America- Divine and National 
Movement is the National Government of the National Republic of the United State of America.  
12 Power: means n. 1. The ability or capacity to perform or act effectively. Political or 
national strength (resources minerals, precocious metals), the ability to do an act. HKMSTA:

nothing more. Forces changes not, but power changes as the ethers change. Force is the will

and By-Laws. Redeem is wider in its application than ransom, and means to buy back, regain 
possession of, or exchange for money, goods, etc.: to redeem one's property. To ransom is 
to redeem a person from captivity by paying a stipulated price, or to redeem from sin by 
sacrifice: to ransom a kidnapped child.  Oxford Dictionary: Archaic: Free (oneself or

element of autonomy or self-government, that is, the independence of the community as a 
whole from the interference of any foreign power in its affairs or any subjection to such 
power, it is further necessary to the constitution of a nation that it should be an organized 
jural society, that is, both governing its own members by regular laws, and defining and 
protecting their rights, and respecting the rights and duties which attach to it as a 
constituent member of the family of nations.

Noble Dew Ali. The Bey and El are titles of/and for Moorish Americans; titles are the 
property of the founder of such a title and subject to the stipulation of the original holder or 
Father/Parent/Founder; that being the Royal Prince NDA, and only his heirs will inherit 
this title of their father by the stipulations he set forth in his testamentary to his children and

National vs Federal  
The two political jurisdictions/nations within the United States* 
Another important distinction needs to be made.  Definition 1 above refers to the country 
“United States*”, but this country is not a “nation”, in the sense of international law.  This 
very important point was made clear by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1794 in the case of 
Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. (U.S.) 419, 1 L.Ed. 440 (1793) , when it said: 
This is a case of uncommon magnitude. One of the parties to it is a State; certainly 
respectable, claiming to be sovereign. The question to be determined is, whether this State, 
so respectable, and whose claim soars so high, is amenable to the jurisdiction of the 
Supreme Court of the United States? This question, important in itself, will depend on 
others, more important still; and, may, perhaps, be ultimately resolved into one, no less 
radical than this 'do the people of the United States form a Nation?' A cause so conspicuous 
and interesting, should be carefully and accurately viewed from every possible point of sight. 
I shall examine it; 1st. By the principles of general jurisprudence. 2nd. by the laws and 
practice of particular States and Kingdoms. From the law of nations little or no illustration 
of this subject can be expected. By that law the several States and Governments spread over 
our globe, are considered as forming a society, not a NATION. It has only been by a very 
few comprehensive minds, such as those of Elizabeth and the Fourth Henry, that this last 
great idea has been even contemplated. 3rdly. and chiefly, I shall examine the important 
question before us, by the Constitution of the United States, and the legitimate result of 
that valuable instrument. [Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. (U.S.) 419, 1 L.Ed. 440 (1793)]. 
PAGE 148 
An earlier edition of Black’s Law Dictionary further clarifies the distinction between a 
“nation” and a “society” by clarifying the differences between a national government and a 
federal government, and keep in mind that the American government is called “federal 
government”:  
“NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.  The government of a whole nation, as distinguished from 
that of a local or territorial division of the nation, and also as distinguished from that of a 
league or confederation.  
“A National Government is a government of the people of a single state or nation, united 
as a community by what is termed the “social compact,’ and possessing complete and 
perfect supremacy over persons and things, so far as they can be made the lawful objects of 
civil government.  
A Federal Government is distinguished from a national government by it being the 
government of a community of independent and sovereign states, united by compact.”  
Piqua Branch Bank v. Knoup, 6 Ohio.St. 393.” [Black’s Law Dictionary, Revised Fourth 
Edition, 1968, p. 1176] 
“FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. The system of government administered in a state formed by 
the union or 
Confederation of several independent or quasi-independent states; also the composite state 
so formed.  
In 
strict 
usage, there is a distinction between a confederation and a federal government. The former 
term denotes a league or permanent alliance between several states, each of which is fully 
sovereign and independent, and each of which retains its full dignity, organization, and 
sovereignty, though yielding to the central authority a controlling power for a few limited 
purposes, such as external and diplomatic relations. In this case, the component states are 
the units, with respect to the confederation, and the central government acts upon them, 
not upon the individual citizens. 
In a federal government, on the other hand, the allied states form a union,-not, indeed, to 
such an extent as to destroy their separate organization or deprive them of quasi sovereignty 
with respect to the administration of their purely local concerns, but so that the central 
power is erected into a true state or nation, possessing sovereignty both external and 
internal,-while the administration of national affairs is directed, and its effects felt, not by 
the separate states deliberating as units, but by the people of all. In their collective capacity, 
as citizens of the nation. The distinction is expressed, by the German writers, by the use of 
the two words "Staatenbund" and "Bundesstaut;" the former denoting a league or 
confederation of states, and the latter a federal government, or state formed by means of a 
league or confederation.” [Black’s Law Dictionary, Revised Fourth Edition, 1968, p. 740]  
PAGE 149 
So the “United States*” the country is a “society” and a “sovereignty” but not a “nation” 
under the law of nations, by the Supreme Court’s own admission.  Because the Supreme 
Court has ruled on this matter, it is now incumbent upon each of us to always remember it 
and to apply it in all of our dealings with the Federal Government.  If not, we lose our 
individual Sovereignty by default and the Federal Government assumes jurisdiction over us.   
An Asiatic who is a“ 14th Amendment citizen” ( One who has not proclaimed his/her 
nationality with the lawful Moorish Science Temple of America is called a statutory “U.S. 
citizen” under 8 U.S.C. §1401, and he is treated in law as occupying a place not protected by 
the Bill of Rights, which is the first ten amendments of the United States Constitution.

Allah’s Holy Prophet told E. Mealy El our first Supreme 
Grand Sheik appointed by the Prophet himself. ‘The 
Prophet told me dear Moslems.’ “I have put my law in 
your hand and my word in your mouth, and you are to 
tell them what to do, and they are to obey. Tell them my 
law hold up me before them. If you will hold me up 
before them, I will draw all men unto me.”  [RE: E. Mealy
El’s state documents (see Moorish American Scholar Hist. fact on E. 
Mealy El 1929-1934)]
The facts are: ‘There is only One Prophet and One 
Temple’; then why do we have all these sets and splinter 
groups calling themselves Moorish Science Temple of 
America etc.? It is obvious through observation and 
application that theses splinter groups do not know where 
the authority lies. We conclude that this is due to the lack 
of scientific study on the subject matter of Nationality
, 
which our Prophet Noble Drew Ali said ‘is the order of 
the day’.   
There are too many belief systems with no 
facts to determine a right understanding, thus bringing 
about a misunderstanding of what the Holy Prophet 
established, and an idea that the Prophet did not fully 
establish all it takes to save us here in North America.  
And this brings about a falsehood,(because of his 
demonstration from  1913-1929) and the mere ideas of 
man become paramount, in looking for redemption out of 
the state of being a 2nd class citizen, a corporation, 
statutory citizen, and debtor, person, Black, Colored 
Person, a Negro or African American. 
In addition, the lower self perpetuates this 
illusionary state of thinking.  ‘I can do my own thing, or 
thinking you can take a little of this Moorish Science 
(using the name Bey or El or the old Temple names 
established by the Prophet) and go out and do you with it. 
Start up little sects, clubs, 501(c) 3 corporations’ and call 
it Moorish Science this or that, so you can be the Man, 
get recognized, or play the hero.  You cannot do your own 
HERE IS WHY. Primarily doing YOUR own thing is 
not what Allah’s Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali 
established. When he came back he knew you had [and 
now have] mental slavery, and a European Psychology, 
that stagnated your progress, no knowledge of self, and 
therefore will remain a slave to everybody else.  Noble 
Drew Ali was not even doing his thing; being Allah’s 
holy prophet he was sent to bring us the everlasting 
gospel of Allah, (KQMA #40) and save us from the 
wrath of Allah, that awful day which is sure to come. 
Moreover, he did just that, and left his foot prints clearly 
cut for those of us to see which way he went. He kept the 
political complex answer to our collective problem 
wrapped up in the term ‘Nationality’ and secured it under 
Religion (check mate!!) for our in-depth research and 
made it the order of the day to show it’s priority for us to 
understand. 
NATIONALITY THE ORDER OF THE DAY 
Why is Nationality the order of the day? Has anyone ever 
answered or asked that question to their Sheik or better 
yet yourself? Good. 
The Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali and his divine 
Ministers of his cabinet gave out calling cards to the 
Asiatics of North America, which told us to… “Come all 
ye Asiastics and learn the Truth about your Nationality 
and Birthrights, because you are not colored, etc. And 
you must claim a free national name to be an American 
citizen…” Did you get your divine calling? This was the 
first document that one got from the Prophet or Sheik. If 
one would have read their calling, card and define the 
subject matter ‘nationality’ a lot of one’s own doubts 
would stop. 
thing!

”WHAT YOUR ANCINT FOREFATHERS WERE, YOU ARE TODAY WITHOUT DOUBT OF CONTRADICTION. THER IS 
NO ONE WHO IS ABLE TO CHANGE MAN FROM THE DESCENDANT NATURE OF HIS FOREFATHERS UNLESS HIS 
POWER EXTENDS BEYOUND THE GREAT UNIVERSAL CREATOR ALLAH HIMSELF.” (MHK XLVII:10-11)
The Original Divine Calling Cards 1916-1929 
“THE TIME HAS COME WHEN EVERY NATION MUST WORSHIP UNDER ITS OWN VINE AND FIG TREE” (MHK XLVII: 15) 
[BLK’sLaw6th] Nationality: “that quality or character which arise from the fact of a person’s belonging to a nation or state. 
Nationality determines the political status especially with reference to allegiance; while domicile determines his civil status. Nationality arises 
ether by birth or naturalization.”   Nationality affords the state jurisdiction over the person and affords the person the protection of the state. 
The two most important parts of this particular definition to understand from a scientific eye is domicile and thee most important from these 
two are political status. 
Some facts about Nationality: 1.1 is a political status, 1.2 is defined by the Constitution, which is a political document. 1.3 Is synonymous with 
being a ‘national’ within statutory law. 1.4. Gives one the right to political association. 1.5 Gives one constitutional citizenship. 1.6 Is 
associated with a specific country. 1.7 Is called a ‘political citizen’ or a citizen of the United States in a political sense, by the courts to 
distinguish it from a STATUTORY citizen. See Powel v United States, 109 F.2d 147 (1940), Nationality therefore is the principle relationship 
that connects an individual to a state. Let us Look a Political Status and begin to connect the dots.  [BLK 6th p.1158] Political: pertaining or 
relating to the policy or the administration of government, state or national. Pertaining to or incidental to, the exercise of the functions vested 
in those charged with the conduct of government; of or pertaining to exercise of rights and privileges or the influence by which individuals of 
a state seek to determine or control its public policy; having to do with organization or action of individual parties. Political status gives one 
Political Rights.  Political Rights are those, which may be exercised in the formation or administration of the government. Rights of a citizen 
established or recognized by constitution (Act 6.) which gives them the power to participate directly or indirectly in the establishment or 
administration of government. The holy Prophet was reported as saying, “I’m going to leave the European here just long enough to teach 
you how to run a government.” In addition, it all starts with understanding nationality. Nationality gives one Political Right’s within those 
political rights is the right of association to associate with your political community; the right to freedom of association and freedom from 
compelled association, (first Amendment to the Constitution). Association is the freedom to choose; choose  a domicile,(“…let the bonds of 
affection, therefore unite thee with thy brothers, that peace and happiness may dwell in thy father’s house and when ye separate in the 
world, remember the relation that bindeth you to love and unity; and prefer not a stranger before thy own blood.” HKofMSTofA XXV: 2
3) it is voluntarily entered into. Please at this stage pay very close attention….When you choose your associations (political community) 
which is determined by your ‘Domicile’  you have chosen your Civil Status  or Legal status. At this stage if one has proclaimed his nationality 
with the lawful government aka The Moorish Science Temple of America; Home Office of Noble Drew Ali, Chicago, Il USA and its lawful 
branch temples (Act 1. Additional Laws) you are a ‘National’…  (We the People) well that is yet to be determined. Let us define a few more 
terms before we move on. Domicile: a person’s legal home. That place where a man has his true fixed, and permanent home and principal 
establishment, and to which whenever he is absent has the intention of returning. Smith v. Smith 206 Pa.Super.310, 213 A.2d 94. Generally. 
Physical presence within a state and the intention to make it ones home are the request of establishing a ‘domicile’ therein. A person may 
have more than one residence but only one domicile.

New Era of Time 126 AB 
A third prophecy is attributed to Muhammad himself, and may have formed the basis for other prophecies’. It is related that Muhammad was asked about the 
end of the world and what would happen thereafter to his community. Muhammad replied, “that the world will come to an end when the most perverse and 
worst people appear at a time when a part of his community will still be in an island situated in the extreme west…The conflict between Islam and 
Christianity will end with a return to the law of the Moors. There will be much cloud in that year, scarcity of water, trees bearing extra fruits, and other 
signs.” [emphasis added] 
The legal domicile
of a person is important since it rather than the actual 
resident often controls the jurisdiction of the taxing authorities and 
determines where a person may exercise the privileges/rights of voting 
and other legal rights and immunities. (Speaking on taxes for all you  
who are reluctant about taxes ...Being domicile and not nationality is 
what imputes a status under the tax code and a liability for tax. Tax 
liability is civil liability that attaches to civil statutory law, which 
attaches to a ‘person’ through their choice
of domicile. {Your Per
Capita Tax Card is very important. To be able to prove you pay taxes to 
your lawful Civil government were your domiciled at,} (Those with 
eyes to see and ears to hear should be tuning in about their tax 
situation...Ask you are self-can they tax a Religious Body Politic. What 
about an agent [missionary] from that Body politic? [See 1099 form; 
‘Our Authority’]) No one can force you to acquire or retain a domicile 
anywhere, including within the federal zone or to accept the civil status 
that attaches to it of statutory citizen (14th Amendment citizen) or 
resident. It is voluntary. Domicile determines your Civil and Legal and 
Statutory status. It does not determine your Political status or 
Nationality. Civil Status or Legal status: (Civil: originally pertaining to 
or appropriate to a member of a civitas or free political community; 
natural or proper to a citizen {National}. Also, relating to the 
community, or to the policy and government of the citizen and subject 
of a state.) Civil Status: gives you 1. The ability to contract with other 
parties including the government. 2. Politically and legally associate 
with groups you choose to associate with. *3. Choose or nominate the 
civil government that you want to protect your rights to life liberty and 
property...this is where your jury of peers is established, etc.3.1 
choosing a domicile is an act of political association that has legal 
consequences in which you nominate a specific municipal government 
to protect your rights and property.[In others word the local 
governmental  laws that will govern you]  This is why the Declaration 
of Independence says that all just powers of government are derived 
from the consent of the people. Those who do not concede to a civil 
municipality have no civil protection or real Civil Rights you would be 
automatically   presumed to have a statutory citizenship status[14th 
Amendment citizen see Civiliter Mortuus or Civil Death]. Domicile is 
how you exercise rights 2 and 3. You can choose where your domicile 
is and you can change it at any time. 
When you choose a domicile, you elect or nominate a 
protector, which in turn gives rise to an obligation to pay for the civil 
protection demanded. The method of providing that protection is the 
civil laws of the municipal (as in county [Branch Temple]) jurisdiction 
that you chose a domicile within; ( Divine Constitution and By-Laws, 
Additional Laws, the Koran, General Laws, Supreme Laws, Rules, and 
Regulations, of the Prophet are the civil laws of the  Religious 
government (MSTof A))…Now what does it all mean? Well when one 
proclaims a Nationality their Political Status {political rights} is 
established (‘National’ of the United States of America,  Moorish 
American) giving you the choice to associate with a political 
community(Grand Temple, Grand Major Temples, Branch Temples) to 
establish your Civil Status/Legal Status your laws that will govern you. 
by your choice of Domicile;(Home Office of Noble Drew Ali Chicago, 
Il) thus creating the political or constitutional and civil status of a 
human being. A  National a true American citizen of the United States 
of America the Republic. A Moorish American!  We The People,  
Let us go a little further. Nationality gives you your 
citizenship as a national, a constitutional citizen. 
Citizens
are members of a political community who in 
their associated capacity, have established or submitted 
themselves to the dominion of a government. {The 
Religious Body Politic aka Moorish Science Temple of 
America.} By giving up some of their natural rights for 
the promotion of their general wellfare and the protection 
of their individual as well as collective rights. Herriot v 
City of Seattle 81 Wash. 2d 48 500 P 2nd 101, 109
.  
Citizen
one who under the Constitution and laws of the 
United States of America or of a particular state, is a 
member of the political community owing  allegiance 
(allegiance is associated with Nationality allegiance is 
what makes one a citizen/subject of a country.)  And 
being entitled to the enjoyments of full Civil Rights
. 
Ones full Civil Rights
are enforced through municipal 
civil law, which in turn can only attach to ones choice of 
legal domicile. 
Now for those who believe that being a Private 
Individual or alien national is going to protect you 
because you got this status by way of paper work/ucc 
etc... You are the executor of such n such estate you have 
copied right to your name, you are power of attorney 
etc., etc., etc..  (You may be getting small reprievable 
remedies for now but).  When private individuals of one 
nation (states of the union) spread themselves through 
another as business or caprice may direct, mingling 
indiscriminately with the inhabitants of that other or 
when merchant vessels enter for the purpose of trade it 
would be inconvenient and dangerous to  society, and 
would subject the law to continuous infractions… if such 
Individual or merchant did not owe temporary and local 
allegiance and were not amenable to the jurisdiction of 
the country… the implied license, therefore under which
 
They enter can never be construed to grant such exemption 7 Cranch 144
. “…the implied license under 
which private individuals of another nation enter the territory and mingle indiscriminately with its 
inhabitants for purpose of business or pleasure can never be construed to grant to them an exemption from 
the jurisdiction of the country in which they are found. See also Carlisle v U.S. (1872)16 Wall. 147, 155 
Radich v Hutchins (1877) 95 U.S. 210.
So even if you have done all that paper work and think yourself untouchable…WAM-BAM ‘applied 
license’ all because you failed to see that The Moorish Science Temple of America (the correct one…there 
is but One) is the only soul foundation where the Asiatic of North America will find his/her salvation 
under! ..Now just because you failed to see does not mean defeat. You must be domiciled in your Political 
Community; a branch temple of the MSTof A (Act 1 Additional Laws) which is attached to The One 
Temple your domicile.  
All the fancy names, The Great Amexem such and such these great so called Orders of this and that all 
theses sects and clubs, and 501(c) 3’s with Moorish this and that as your name. Your heart may be right 
looking for the salvation established by the Prophet Noble Drew Ali but your association is wrong. The 
facts are if you are not domiciled in your own municipality as a constitutional citizen; then no matter what 
you do. And this could be hard for some to swallow…You are subject to the civil laws that you were born 
(formed) in; and the only civil laws attached to a Negro is statutory civil laws of  a 14th Amendment citizen. 
Most Moors today have a birth certificate with the misnomer Negro as the nationality. Your birth 
certificates acts as your place of resident  (being over 18 legal age to consent  you freely made a choice to 
stay as a resident on record and registered , by way of your birth certificate in a federal zone)  that 
determines your civil laws that will govern you.  
All must see were the authority lies, and that’s with the Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali sent from Allah 
to saves us from the wrath of Allah, period! The Prophets One Temple; known as the Moorish Science 
Temple of America. That is why he put his face on the documents. He is the seal, on the charter; he is the 
Moorish Science Temple of America and you cannot separate the two. Plus he had to put his face on the 
documents so we would know the real one, he is a prophet he saw all this coming… and even after he put 
his seal on all official records Laws, Regulations, Rules Organic Law, Koran (ecclesiastical and Secular 
laws) etc. still some choose to follow the so-called  reincarnated so-called Prophet. The  C. Kirckman Bey, 
Lomax Bey, the Dingel El’s, W.Frad Muhammad, German Bey, C. M. Bey etc. etc. etc.   And these are the 
facts. So you have today brothers and sisters thinking they can do, they own thing without the Prophet and 
his lawful succession. It’s not enough to just put his name in your documents, on web sites, have a bey or el 
attached to your acquired last name without properly; being part and parcel via-your Per Capita Tax Card, 
Dues card, Nationality and Identification Card for the Moorish Science Temple of America etc..  (And 
Birthrights for the Moorish Americans.) in the correct Temple.  Your Dues Card establishes your years in 
the Temple in your local municipal government by way of No. of Temple on the card and Domicile at 
Home office.  Per Capita Tax Card show you are paying tax to you jurisdiction and numerates you as parcel 
and establish jurisdiction to your Body Politic. Study your Nationality and Identification Card it is all there 
too.   
RE: The Prophet‘s Warning To The Nations Friday, March 1, 1928; 
“Money (Notes) does not make 
the man; it is free national standards (association) and power (establish your own municipal 
government; connect ‘Home Rule Charter’, the prophet left no stone unturned) that make a man and 
nation. The wealth of all National Governments, gold, silver (what creditor deal in), commerce, 
(Uniform Commercial Code) belongs to the citizen alone; and without your national citizenship by 
name and principle, (the holy and divine laws) you have no true wealth…” (Emphasis added).  
Question; when has a Negro ever been a citizen of the USA; I will tell you NEVER! (See Dread Scott 
case 1864
) So what gives him/her the right to act as a citizen (1st class) in commerce? Doing business as a 
National (one who holds the credit of the nation)? Also clamming to be sovereign you went from a Negro 
to sovereign- oooBoy how you do that? By way of commerce? Ucc?  Were you had to be a true citizen to 
fully use that body of law… sounds fishy. Remember money does not make a man, money an interments 
used in commerce; its free national standards that make a man. A ‘Man’ you were 3/5 a man; free national 
standards are (Nationality and Divine Creed the two parts that were missing from your status to make you a 
Man/Human.)  Let us move on and conclude this academic.

Sec. 1101 (a) (21)
National
can also be described as a “citizen” when he/she is domiciled within the territorial and legislative 
jurisdiction of the Political Body to which one claims allegiance, being a ‘National” is therefore an attribute 
and a prerequisite of being a citizen and the term can be used to describe ‘citizen.” 
“Any group of people who fail to answer up to the Constitutional Standards of Law by name and 
principle, (Charter) because to be a citizen of any government you must claim your national name 
and descent.”  
“I the prophet was prepared by the Great God Allah to warn my people to repent from their 
sinful ways, and go back to the state of mind of their forefathers’ divine and National Principles-that 
they will be law abiders and receive their divine rights as citizens according to the free national 
Constitution that was prepared for all free national beings, they are to claim their own free national 
name and religion. There is but one issue for the to be recognized by this Government (USA) and of 
the earth and that comes ONLY THROUGH the connection (in association with) of the Moorish 
Divine National Movement, which is incorporated in this government and recognized by all other 
Nations (States of the union also) of the world. And through it, they and their children can receive 
their divine rights (Political Rights, Real Civil Rights within Religious Body Politic etc) unmolested 
by other citizens”.  RE: The Prophet Warning To The Nation Friday November 30, 1928 (Emphasis 
added)  
One also becomes a constitutional citizen or citizen in a common law or Constitutional sense by being 
born (implies nationality)or naturalized in a country and exercising their first Amendment rights of political 
association by voluntarily choosing a national (Proclaiming your nationality) and a municipal domicile in 
that country. 
Let us tie in the checkmate move the holy Prophet put up. Religion
religion all-of –a suadeen…  
for all those bandwagon haters of 
“While we the Moorish Americans, are returning to Islam, which was founded by our forefathers 
for our earthly and divine salvation.”  RE: HKofMSTofA The End Of Time and The Fulfilling Of The 
Prophesies
p.67-68 verse 8 
(Our Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America are Ecclesiastical & Secular Laws for 
Moorish Americans) see BlaK. Laws 6th: Koran: The Mohammedain book of faith, it contains both 
ecclesiastical and secular laws. 
See RE: Our Authority 2nd ¶
“The Moorish Science Temple of America deriving its power and 
authority for the Grate Koran of Mohammed to propagate the faith and extend the learning and the truth of 
the Great Prophet of Ali in America.” 
“In these modern days, there came a forerunner who was divinely prepared by the great God-Allah, and 
his name is Marcus Garvey, who did teach and warn the nations of the earth to prepared to meet the coming 
prophet who was to bring the true and divine Creed of Islam; and his name is Noble Drew Ali who was 
prepared and sent to this earth by Allah to teach the old time religion and the everlasting gospel to the sons 
of men, that every nation shall and must worship under their own vine and fig tree and return to their own 
and be one with their Farther God-Allah.” (emphasis added)   RE: HKofMSTofA The  End Of Time And 
The Fulfilling of The Prophases p.67v3
The entire structure of the Moorish Science Temple of America is Religious its citizens, its laws, 
customs, duties, Rules, Regulations, Why the Bey and El you hold is religious. Because all is under a 
Religious Body Politic a Nation. See RE: the law holds up our Authority “Corporation-Religious Affidavit 
of Organization”. Religious Corporation Act Ch. 32 par.164 Sec.35 
“Any church, congregation or society 
formed for the purpose of religious worship may become incorporated in the following… and may adopt a 
corporate, by name… it shall and remain a body politic and corporate, by the name so adopted. 
What do other laws say about Religion? 
RFRA (Religious freedom and restoration Act) The supreme Court had found “exercise” to be burdened 
when laws interfere with a particular religious practice or ceremony (Gonzales v O Centro espirita 
Beneficento Uniao do Vegetal, 564. U.S. 418 (2000)
“Courts may not decide matters of church doctrine or governance.”(Cf. Kedroff v St. Nicholas Cathedral, 
344 U.S. 94,116 (1952))
U.S. v Ballard (1944)
The Courts found that neither neither the courts nor the government have the right to 
evaluate the religious beliefs of a citizen or group.  
*Waston v Jones, 80 U.S. (13 Wall
) Courts may not interfere in matters of church doctrine, discipline or 
policy.  
[T]he First Amendment rest upon the premise that both religion and government can best work to achieve 
their lofty aims if each is left free from the other within it-respected sphere. (Jurisdiction) Justice Hugo 
Black (Mc Collum v Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203, 212 (1984))
According to the United States Supreme Acts of State to wit: “Every sovereign state (people) is bound to 
respect the independence of every other sovereign State (people) and the courts of  another country will 
NOT SIT in Judgment on the acts of the government of another, done within its own territory.” 
Also where rights are secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule-making or 
legislation which would abrogate them Miranda v Arizona 384 US 436,125: (10) 
The claim and exercise of constitutional rights cannot be converted into a crime. Miller v Kansas 230 F 2nd 
486 489:(11)
Missionaries Man or Woman piece it together can you not see your earthly and divine salvation the Holy 
Prophet Noble Drew Ali establish for us. Keep the Prophet out in front, because his was tried and true. It 
stands as a fact today!! And all this above come by way of your nationality, better yet you truly 
understanding Your Nationality.  
In conclusion  
I hope this academic brings moor light to the importance of ‘KEEPING THE PROPHET OUT IN 
FRONT’ the jurisprudence thereof. My intention was not to offend any organization or group. We need not 
chase after the gods of Europe and mere ideas of man to save ourselves.  Allah’s holy Prophet got us! 
And that’s a fact! Some might need to as I did; to smash the ego, and humble themselves and  
“Say not unto thyself, “Behold, truth breedeth hatred, and I will avoid it; dissimulation (to disguise 
ones intentions under a feigned appearance) raisheth friends, and I will follow it.” Are not the enemies, 
made by truth better than friends obtained by flattery?”  HKofMSTofA XLIII : 18
