All praises are due to Allah.  
Highest Honors to Allah’s Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali, honors to Moorish Americans, 
Moslems and Asiatics in this new era of time, honors to our Supreme Grand Sheik E. 
Braswell Bey to all National Officers, Sheiks, Shekesses, Governors, and all that is Moorish 
brought by the noble prophet Drew Ali, honors to those on the path and honors to all 
nationalities and nations praising the Great God under their own vine and fig tree and 
honors to whom honor is due.  
PREFACE  
“There is but one Allah, the author, the creator, the governor of the world, almighty, 
eternal, and incomprehensible.” RE: HKMSTA1 Ch. XXXV: 1 1 
“He hath instituted laws for the government of the world; He hath wonderfully varied them in 
all beings; and each, by his nature conformeth to His will.” HKMSTA Ch. XXXV: 10  
As a Moorish American we are instructed to “Know thyself and Allah.” This is “Thee Law” the 
science of Moorish Science also known as the “Knowledge of Self” and/or the ‘path’ or ‘way’ or 
life. To accomplish such a lofty idea is to be on the path, “Islamism” or Peace, the Divine 
instructions for all Moslems; Peace with God, Man, Nature/ones surroundings for a 
simplified understanding. As a Grand Sheik meaning one proficient in the degrees of law 
to understand the way, so as to further instruct and be of service to ones brothers & sisters 
and others on the path. Thus said it is understood… “The way, is life, and life is the path, 
of “Thee Law”2 “; deeper still, being the very law one comes to manifest. All Law is 
established in ‘Truth’ which is Holy Breath, Aught, Allah (All -La (h) w). Truth is 
that which changes not.  
In the divine instructions for Man it is understood that “… In all the world there are two 
things. The one is truth, the other is falsehood, and falsehood is that which seems to be. 
Now truth is aught and has no cause, and yet it is the cause of everything. Falsehood is 
naught and yet it is the manifest of right. Whatever has been made will be unmade; that 
which begins must end.” HKMSTA Ch. VII: 4-7 –  
“Man is truth and falsehood strangely mixed.” Man is breath made flesh; so truth and 
falsehood are conjoined in him and then they thrive, and naught goes down and man as 
truth abides.” Ch.VII:13 [speaking; {Public Minister}-day star from on high, aka Jesus the Christ] 
In the light of the above… “Thee Law is the unshakeable pillars of truth, dispelling the 
darkness of falsehood, reveling the light, to settle in peace.”

Ecclesiastical and secular laws for Moorish Americans & Moslems  
2Quote by: The Scientist 
PAGE 2 
Laws for civilized Governments, their Religions, Science, Philosophy are grown 
out of this ‘Force’ of nature and its natural development constituted by a Prophet of Allah, 
one sent to deliver “Thee Law “and appoint those faithful to the truth, (trustee); for the 
greatest development of its people to their highest potential which is the nature of its 
source, that being Truth. In essence all true and divine laws come from Allah and due to 
the divine nature of Allah the laws from Allah to Man are to guide, to instruct to a perfect 
state of being or being Peace itself. It is the need for civilized man to develop ways and 
paths to better comprehend true Law or the ‘Force’, more comprehensively understood the 
Will of Allah, and institute civilizations that harmonize with that Will. (i.e. Moorish

Heaven, a religious Body Politic a Divine Nation-state establish 1913 A.D. by the “Will of 
Allah” through His Holy and Noble Prophet Drew Ali.(Amen).

0000 2664 0443 in due form of a good faith letter and Articles of Incorporation pursuant 
to 805 LCS 110/46a-46k ch.36, but not limited to. In connection with our hopes aims, rules 
and articles of religion, I deem it proper to simit to you a brief statement in good faith of 
our organization without prejudice and without recourse, covering its rise and progress, 
our mission and status, which I hope will be satisfactory to you. I also hope it will be the 
means of causing you at all times to adhere to the principles of Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom

combative, belligerent or terrorist groups domestic or foreign, we are non-combative, non
belligerent, we are neutral also we have no affiliation with any kind of sovereign citizen, 
group(s) but not limited to;  
We organized as The Moorish Temple of Science in the year of 1925, and where legally 
incorporated as a civic organization under the laws of the state of Illinois, November 29th 
1926. The name Moorish Temple of Science changed to the Moorish Science Temple of 
America, May 1928, in accordance with the legal requirements of the Secretary of state of 
Illinois. The RCA (Religious Corporation Act of 1871) provides that “[a]ny church, 
congregation or society formed for the purpose of religious worship, may become 
incorporated” in the manner specified in the Act 805 ILCS 110/35, Ch. 32 and their 
subordinate bodies may become incorporated in like manner under the head organization 
805 ILCS 110/46a-46k Ch. 36; supra said Branch Temple No. 43 became incorporated in 
PAGE 3 
like manner in 2014. Some states and attorneys are simply not aware that the RCA is a 
legal alternative to the NFPCA.  
That, our Divine and National Movement stands for the specific grand principles 
of Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom and Justice. A national organization with a Rotarian 
complexion as it relates to districts branch temples in different sections of the country.

them and family. In the Divine plan of the Ages our Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali and 
Founder of the Moorish Science Temple of America He has given us the means to dispel 
any forms of Mental Slavery caused from a European psychology. We shall teach from the 
Divine Instructions for the fallen sons and daughters of the Asiatics of North America, so 
as to give you instructions on how to Love and stop the hate and destruction of one’s self

Disclamer 
This book has come into the manifest from the need for a single source of material were  all  the Holy Prophets Divine Laws, Rules and 
Regulations are compiled so as to make it easier referencing the laws while studying the laws that govern Moorish Americans,  and 
family and Nation. This is not an attempt to make any laws or enforce any laws or to cause confusion. To ensure this is the case we have 
only defined and copied the Divine laws as laid down to us by our Holy Prophet we did not interpret. Every Divine Law as spoken by 
the Prophet Noble Drew Ali is within this Law book as of the writing of this book. I, Mr. C. Jones Bey Historian of Temple No. 24, 
currently Grand Sheik of MSTA Temple 43 Los Angeles Calif.  Also we have defined all words from certain documents that the holy 
Prophet spoke on. We have defined the words through the Moorish Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America and Blacks 
Laws dictionaries we have pieced together the history of our Prophet Noble Drew Ali from word of mouth passed down through our 
elders and sheiks and from recorded history of newspaper articles. Mostly from Moorish Guide New Papers of the late 20’s; some events 
will become more accurate as the documented facts become more assessable. One must know the laws that govern you so that you will 
always be in compliance and  know if you are being misused by others, ignorance of the law is now excuse, ignorance of the facts can 
be excused until you get the facts.  I would like to state that it would do one well to find an unabridged dictionary the older the better 
also an Oxford international dictionary to study from also. We have also compiled and prepared a concordance of the Holy Koran of the 
Moorish Science Temple of America for those academics and faithful Moorish Americans.

PURITY 
Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey edited by Amy Jacques-Garvey 
History is the landmark by which we are directed into the true course of life. The history 
of a 
movement, the history of a nation, the history of a race is the guide-post of that 
movement’s 
destiny, that nation's destiny, that race's destiny. What you do today that is worthwhile, 
inspires 
others to act at some future time. 
Chance has never yet satisfied the hope of a suffering people. Action, self-reliance, the 
vision of 
self and the future have been the only means by which the oppressed have seen and 
realized the 
light of their own freedom. 
Life is that existence that is given to man to live for a purpose, to live to his own 
satisfaction and 
pleasure, providing he forgets not the God who created him and who expects a spiritual 
obedience and observation of the moral laws that He has inspired. 
There is nothing in the world common to man, that man cannot do. 
The ends you serve that are selfish will take you no further than yourself; but the ends you 
serve 
that are for all, in common, will take you even into eternity. 
It is only the belief and the confidence we have in a God why man is able to understand 
his own 
social institutions, and move and live like a rational human being. Take away the highest 
ideal: 
PAGE 17 
faith and confidence in a God, and mankind at large is reduced to savagery and the race 
destroyed. 
A race without authority and power, is a race without respect. 
Criticism is an opinion for good or ill, generally indulged in by the fellow who knows 
more than 
anyone else, yet the biggest fool. There is no criticism that calls not forth yet another. The 
last 
critic is the biggest fool of all, for the world starts and ends with him. He is the source of 
all 
knowledge, yet knows nothing, for there is not a word one finds to use that there is not 
another 
that hath the same meaning, then wherefore do we criticize? 
Fear is a state of nervousness fit for children and not men. When man fears a creature like 
himself he offends God, in whose image and likeness he is created. Man being created 
equal 
fears not man but God. To fear is to lose control of one's nerves; one's will, to flutter, like a 
dying 
fowl, losing consciousness, yet alive. 
Ambition is the desire to go forward and improve one's condition. It is a burning flame 
that lights 
up the life of the individual and makes him see himself in another state. To be ambitious 
is to be 
great in mind and soul; to want that which is worthwhile and strive for it; and to go on 
without 
looking back, reaching to that which gives satisfaction. To be humanly ambitious is to take 
in the 
world which is the province of man; to be divinely ambitious is to offend God by rivaling 
him in 
His infinite majesty. 
Admiration is a form of appreciation that is sometimes mistaken for something else. 
There may 
PAGE 18 
be something about you that suggests good fellowship when kept at a distance, but in 
closer 
contact would not be tolerated, otherwise it would be love. 
Religion is one's opinion and belief in some ethical truth. To be a Christian is to have the 
religion 
of Christ, and so to be a believer of Mohammed is to be a Mohammedan but there are so 
many 
religions that every man seems to be a religion unto himself. No two persons think alike, 
even if 
they outwardly profess the same faith, so we have as many religions in Christianity as we 
have 
believers. 
Death is the end of all life in the individual or the thing; if physical, the crumbling of the 
body 
into dust from whence it came. He, who lives not uprightly, dies completely in the 
crumbling of 
the physical body, but he who lives well, transforms himself from that which is mortal, to 
immortal. 
Faithfulness is actuated by a state of heart and mind in the individual that changes not. 
No one is 
wholly faithful to a cause or an object, except his heart and mind remain firm without 
change or 
doubt. If one's attitude or conduct changes toward an object, then one has lost in one's 
faithfulness. It is a wholeness of belief overshadowing all suspicion, all doubt, admitting of 
no 
question; to serve without regret or disgust, to obligate one's self to that which is 
promised Or 
expected, to keep to our word and do our duty well. 
There are but few faithful people now-a days. 
Prohibition is to abstain from intoxicating liquor, as it makes us morbid and sometimes 
drunk. 
PAGE 19 
But we get drunk every day, nevertheless, not so much by the strength of what we sip from 
the 
cup, but that which we eat, the water we drink, and the air we inhale, which at 
fermentation 
conspire at eventide to make us so drunk and tired that we lose control of ourselves and 
fall 
asleep. Everybody is a drunkard, and if we were to enforce real prohibition we should all 
be 
dead. 
There is no strength but that which is destructive, because man has lost his virtues, and 
only 
respects force, which he himself cannot counteract. This is the day of racial activity, when 
each 
and every group of this great human family must exercise its own initiative and influence 
in its 
own protection, therefore, Asiatices should be more determined to-day than they have 
ever been, 
because the mighty forces of the world are operating against non-organized groups of 
peoples, 
who are not ambitious enough to protect their own interests. 
Wake up Ethiopia! Wake up Africa! Let us work towards the one glorious end of a free, 
redeemed and mighty nation. Let Africa be a bright star among the constellation of 
nations. 
A man's bread and butter is only insured when he works for it. 
The world has now reached the stage when humanity is really at the parting of" the ways. 
It is a 
question of "Man Mind Thyself." 
The political readjustment of the world means that those who are not sufficiently able, not 
sufficiently prepared, will be at the mercy of the organized classes for another one or two 
hundred years. 
The only protection against injustice in man is power: physical, financial and scientific. 
PAGE 20 
The masses make the nation and the race. If the masses are illiterate, that is the judgment 
passed 
on the race by those who are critical of its existence. 
The function of the Press is public service without prejudice or partiality, to convey the 
truth as it 
is seen and understood without favoritism or bias. 
Education is the medium by which a people are prepared for the creation of their own 
particular 
civilization, and the advancement and glory of their own race. 
Nationhood is the only means by which modern civilization can completely protect 
itself. 
Independence of nationality, independence of government, is the means of protecting not 
only 
the individual, but the group. Nationhood is the highest ideal of all peoples. 
The evolutionary scale that weighs nations and races, balances alike for all peoples; hence 
we 
feel sure that someday the balance will register a change for the Asiatic. 
If we are to believe the divine injunction, we must realize that the time is coming when 
every 
man and every race must return to its own "vine and fig tree." 
Let Africa be our guiding star: our star of destiny. 
So many of us find excuses to get out of the Asiatic race, because we are led to believe that 
the 
race is unworthy, and that it has not accomplished anything. Cowards that we are! It is we 
who 
are unworthy, because we are not contributing to the uplift and up-building of this noble 
race. 
How dare anyone tell us that Africa cannot be redeemed, when we have 400,000,000 men 
and 
women with warm blood coursing through their veins? The power that holds Africa is not 
divine. 
PAGE 21 
The power that holds Africa is human, and it is recognized that whatsoever man has done, 
man 
can do. 
We of the Asiatic race are moving from one state of organization to another, and we shall 
so 
continue until we have thoroughly lifted ourselves into the organization of government. 
Be as proud of your race today as our fathers were in the days of yore. We have a beautiful 
history, and we shall create another in the future that will astonish the world. 
Woman 
What the night is to the day, is woman to man. The period of change that brings us light 
out of 
darkness, darkness out of light, and semi-light out of darkness are like the changes we find 
in 
woman day by day. She makes one happy, then miserable. You are to her kind, then 
unkind. 
Constant yet inconstant. Thus we have woman. No real man can do without her. 
Love 
A happy but miserable state in which man finds himself from time to time; sometimes he 
believes he is happy by loving, then suddenly he finds how miserable he is. It is all joy, it 
sweetens life, but it does not last. It comes and goes, but when it is active, there is no 
greater 
virtue, because it makes one supremely happy. We cannot hold our love, but there is one 
love 
that never change or is mistaken, and that is God's. The longer we hold our love, the 
nearer we 
approach like unto our Creator. 
The whole world is run on bluff. No race, no nation, no man has any divine right to take 
advantage of others. Why allow the other fellow to bluff you? 
Every student of political science, every student of economics knows that the race can 
only be 
PAGE 22 
saved through a solid industrial foundation; and that the race can only be saved through 
political 
independence. Take away industry from a race; take away political freedom from a race, 
and you 
have a group of slaves. Peoples everywhere are travelling toward industrial opportunities 
and 
greater political freedom. As a race oppressed, it is for us to prepare ourselves that at any 
time 
the great change in industrial freedom and political liberty comes about, we may be able 
to enter 
into the new era as partakers of the joys to be inherited. 
Lagging behind in the van of civilization will not prove our higher abilities. Being 
subservient to 
the will and caprice of progressive races will not prove anything superior in us. Being 
satisfied to 
drink of the dregs from the cup of human progress will not demonstrate our fitness as a 
people to 
exist alongside of others, but when of our own initiative we strike out to build industries, 
governments, and ultimately empires, then and only then will we as a race prove to our 
Creator 
and to man in general that we are fit to survive and capable of shaping our own destiny. 
The world ought to know that it could not keep 400,000,000 Asiatices down forever. 
There is always a turning point in the destiny of every race, every nation, of all peoples, 
and we 
have come now to the turning point of the Asiatic, where we have changed from the old 
cringing 
weakling, and transformed into full-grown men, demanding our portion as men. 
I am not one of those Christians who believe that the Bible can solve all the problems of 
humanity. The Bible is good in its place, but we are men. We are the creatures of God. We 
have 
PAGE 23 
sinned against Him; therefore it takes more than the Bible to keep us in our places. 
Man is becoming so vile that to-day we cannot afford to convert him with moral, ethical, 
physical truths alone, but with that which is more effective—implements of destruction. 
Leadership means everything: pain, blood, death. 
To be prosperous in whatever we do is the sign of true wealth. We may be wealthy in not 
only 
having money, but in spirit and health. It is the most helpful agency toward a self
satisfying life. 
One lives, in an age like this, nearer perfection by being wealthy than by being poor. To 
the 
contended soul, wealth is the stepping stone to perfection; to the miser it is the nearest 
avenue to 
hell. I would prefer to be honestly wealthy, than miserably poor. 
To be free from temptation of other people's property is to reflect the honesty of our own 
souls. 
There are but few really honest people, in that between the thought and the deed we make 
ourselves dishonest. The fellow who steals, acts dishonestly. We can steal in thought as 
well as 
in deed, therefore to be honest is a virtue that but few indulge. To be honest is to be 
satisfied, 
having all, wanting nothing. If you find yourself in such a state then you are honest, if not 
the 
temptation of your soul is bound to make you dishonest. This applies to the king and the 
peasant alike. 
All peoples are struggling to blast a way through the industrial monopoly of races and 
nations, 
but the Asiatic as a whole has failed to grasp its true significance and seems to delight in 
filling only that place created for him by the white man. 
PAGE 24 
The Asiatic who lives on the patronage of philanthropists is the most dangerous member 
of our 
society, because he is willing to turn back the clock of progress when his benefactors ask 
him so 
to do. 
No race in the world is so just as to give others, for the asking, a square deal in things 
economic, 
political and social. 
Men who are in earnest are not afraid of consequences. 
No one knows when the hour of Africa's redemption cometh. It is in the wind. It is 
coming. One 
day, like a storm, it will be here. When that day comes all Africa will stand together. 
Any sane man, race or nation that desires freedom must first of all think in terms of blood. 
Why, 
even the Heavenly Father tells us that "without the shedding of blood there can be no 
remission 
of sins?" Then how in the name of God, with history before us, do we expect to redeem 
Africa 
without preparing ourselves, some of us to die. 
I pray God that we shall never use our physical prowess to oppress the human race, but we 
will 
use our strength, physically, morally and otherwise to preserve humanity and civilization. 
For over three hundred years the white man has been our oppressor, and he naturally is 
not going 
to liberate us to the higher freedom, the truer liberty, and the truer democracy. We have 
to 
liberate ourselves. 
Every man has a right to his own opinion. Every race has a right to its own action; 
therefore let 
no man persuade you against your will, let no other race influence you against your own. 
The greatest weapon used against the Asiatic is disorganization. 
PAGE 25 
If you have no confidence in self you are twice defeated in the race of life. With confidence 
you 
have won even before you have started. 
At no time within the last five hundred years can one point to a single instance of the 
Asiatic as a 
race of haters. The Asiatic has loved even under severest punishment. In slavery the 
Asiatic loved 
his master, he safe-guarded his home even when he further planned to enslave him. We 
are not a 
race of haters, but lovers of humanity's cause. 
Mob violence and injustice have never helped a race or a nation, and because of this 
knowledge 
as gathered from the events of ages, we as a people in this new age desire to love all 
mankind, 
not in the social sense, but in keeping with the divine injunction "Man Love Thy Brother." 
Preparedness is the watch-word of this age. For us as a race to remain, as we have been in 
the 
past, divided among ourselves, parochialtizing, insularizing and nationalizing our 
activities as 
subjects and citizens of the many alien races and governments under which we live—is 
but to 
hold ourselves in readiness for that great catastrophe that is bound to come—that of racial 
extermination, at the hands of the stronger race—the race that will be fit to survive. 
Humanity takes revenging crime from one age to the next, according to the growth and 
development of the race so afflicted. But the perpetuation of crime through revenge and 
retaliation will not save the human race. 
Europe is bankrupt today, and every nation within her bounds is endeavoring to find new 
openings, new fields for exploitation—that exploitation that will bring to them the 
resources, the 
revenue and the power necessary for their rehabilitation and well-being. We are living in a 
PAGE 26 
strenuous, active age, when men see, not through the spectacles of sympathy, but demand 
that 
each and every one measures up in proportion to the world's demand for service. 
The attitude of the white race is to subjugate, to exploit, and if necessary exterminate the 
weaker 
peoples with whom they come in contact. They subjugate first, if the weaker peoples will 
stand 
for it; then exploit, and if they will not stand for subjugation nor exploitation, the other 
recourse is extermination. 
If the Asiatic is not careful he will drink in all the poison of modem civilization and die 
from the effects of it.

Holy Breath of History Bey & El 
The eptomology of the term Moor has the ancient root MR [vowels are interchangeable the 
root of a word is its continents  ] found in Mauraysh (Moorish) also known as TaMaRian 
or MaRu and aMaRuKa i.e. the old Moorish language of what has come to be known as 
Egyptian, or Hebrew.  
The scholarship word know as Kemet that has come down to mean black land or Black 
people land is not the true and divine name for ancient Egypt. The ancient hieroglyphic 
clearly shows that the proper term is Ta’MooRi or Ta’MoRi/TaMaRe; MR or Pa-ta-Mera: 
meaning the ancient land of Egypt4. TaMare, land of the Moor is the hidden and true 
Nationality of the real ancient Egyptians. The word KeMiT is a geographical name where 
the praiseworthy black dirt settled. The root word M-R [an abbreviation for Mister, Master, 
Moor,] comes from the old Moorish language or letters [O.M.L.] …

the universal creator Allah himself...” HKMSTA Ch. 47

Bey’s academic discourse. MR has a deeper meaning in relationship to Moorish 
Americans title’s Bey and El. M-R as we are gathering from the supra means Moor

most biblical dictionaries is ‘Baal’. Baal is an ancient Canaanite God sometimes 
referred to as the ‘Storm God’ knowns as Ra, ASR/Osiris, and Murdock among other 
lands. Now Baal is in fact Bey; [Ba’al] is in reality [Ba El], meaning Son of El the [al] 
was drooped but can also be expressed as [IL], or [El]. [Ba’] was transliterated into 
[Bæ] in old English; [Bæ] went into Middle English transliterated into [Bey]. [BaBa] 
anciently means Father and [Ba] means Son, also Babe (Son); [Ba] is where we get 
[Ra] Son/Sun God. Pronounced [Baaa]- Ra, also Rey. Bey (root B-Y) or Bai, meaning 
Noble Priest or Priest King. When the Moroccan Empire ruled the World (also known 
anciently as Egypt, the Capitol Empire of the Dominion of Africa) all 
Bailiff were Bey-liffs. The term Bey became Bay and Bai 5, Obey. Also, using the 
Hammer to pound in the truth; recent archaeological, biblical, and extra biblical 
research has led scholars working in the area of the origins of Israelite religion to 
assert rather boldly and confidently that the original god of Israel was in fact the 
Canaanite deity El.   
The name Israel is not a Yahwistic name. El is the name of the deity invoked 
in the name Israel, which translates: “May El persevere.” This suggests that El was 
seen as the chief god in the formative years of Israel’s religious practices. In fact, the 
etiological story explaining the origin of the name Israel occurs in Genesis 35:9-15, 
where Jacob obtains this name through the blessing of El Shaddai, which is “El of the 
Mountain.”  
Second, there exist numerous parallels and similarities between descriptions 
and cultural terminology used for El in the Canaanite texts and those used for 
Yahweh in the biblical sources (see below). At some point, it is ascertained, the 
cultural worship of Yahweh must have absorbed that of El, through which means 
Yahweh assimilated both the imagery and epithets once used of El.  
5See E.H.D., vol. I, p. 202 and S.O.E.D., P. 137, SB2, SB3. 
See E.A. Willis Budge “An Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary vol.  
1.p.315 & vol. 2 p. 1050  
PAGE 29 
Finally, there is strong confirmation of this assimilation in the biblical record 
itself. In the oldest literary traditions of the Pentateuch, it is El who regularly 
appears and not Yahweh, or Yahweh as El! The patriarchal narratives identify El as 
the deity to whom many of the early patriarchal shrines and altars were built. For 
example, we are informed in Genesis 33:20 that Jacob builds an altar in the old 
cutural  center of the north, Shechem, and dedicates it to “El, god of Israel” (’el ’elohe 
yišra’el ). There is no ambiguity in the Hebrew here: ’el must be translated as a 
proper name, El. The textual tradition from which this text derives, the Elohist, 
ultimately remembers a time when El was the patron god of Israel.  
That El was the deity worshiped at Shechem is also attested in Judges 9:46, which 
speaks of  
the shrine of “El of the covenant.” The god of the shrine at Bethel, which literally 
translates, “house of El,” is additionally El—”I am El of Bethel” (Gen 31:13; cf. 35:7)—
and appears to Jacob as El Shaddai (35:11; cf. 48:3). Jacob has another encounter with 
El at Penuel, which is so named because Jacob sees El face-toface (32:31). Moreover, 
Isaac blesses Jacob through El Shaddai (28:3), and likewise Jacob blesses Joseph  
“by El of your fathers” (49:25). “El who sees” is given as the etymology of Beerlahai
roi in Genesis 16:13. And we are informed that Abraham journeys to the old cultural 
shrine at Beersheba, where he plants and worships a tree and calls on the name “El 
the eternal” and at the same time Yahweh (Gen 21:33). Contrary to Genesis 33:20, 
where the Shechemite El is presented unambiguously as the “god of Israel,” in 
Genesis 21:33, El is apparently already assimilated to Yahweh (see below). Finally, 
Genesis 14:18-22 speaks of “El the most high,” of whom the Canaanite Melchizedek is 
priest at Jerusalem.  
This assimilation between Yahweh and El, or El into Yahweh, is present in 
much of the Priestly material as well. In fact, the Priestly source largely advocates 
this assimilation. In Genesis 17:1, the  
Priestly writer states that “Yahweh appeared to Abram and said to him: ‘I am El 
Shaddai.’” And Exodus 6:2-3, in contradiction to J (#11), has Yahweh assert: “I am 
Yahweh. And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as El Shaddai, and I was 
not known to them by the name Yahweh.” Although the verse suggests an 
PAGE 30 
identification between Yahweh and El “of the mountain,” the verse also subtly 
recognizes an ancient distinction between the god of the patriarchs (El) and the god 
of the Mosaic era (Yahweh). Perhaps it is necessary at this point to ask: Who was El? 
And why is he even mentioned in the Bible in the first place, let alone as the god of 
Israel in the older literary traditions of Genesis?  
Our knowledge of El predominantly comes from The Holy Koran of the Moorish Science 
Temple of America, Divinely prepared by the Noble Prophet Drew Ali 
Also, there is an  invaluable corpus of tablets  discovered of our ancient Moorish 
forefathers in 1929, the year the Holy Prophet ascended out of flesh, they found  in 
the ancient city of Ugarit, a major city-state of the second millennium BC located on 
the northern coast of Syria, modern day Ras Shamra, the Ugaritic tablets they are 
the best available witness to Canaanite religion and religious practices (today 
known as, The Old time religion [Islamism]6), and “to the background from which 
the religion of Israel emerged, and to the Canaanite beliefs that it shared, adopted, 
compromised with, and sometimes rejected.” The Ugaritic literature depicts El as 
the sovereign deity of the Canaanite pantheon. He is frequently referred to as 
“Father of the gods,” “the eternal King,” and “Creator of all living beings.” El’s other 
epithets include: “El the Kind, the Compassionate,” “the Bull,” “the Ageless One,” and 
“the Father of Years.” He is depicted as bearded, and residing in a tent or a 
tabernacle, whose throne rests on Cherubim. He is the god of blessings and of 
covenants.  
Many of these epithets and images later become assimilated to Yahweh. For 
example, Yahweh is often depicted as bearded, as King of the gods, as 
Compassionate, and as residing in a tent, whose throne, like that of El, rests on 
Cherubim. There are, in addition to this, numerous El epithets in various strains of 
biblical tradition—epithets that through a process of assimilation and adoption 
later become associated with Yahweh. We have already encountered El Shaddai, “El 
of the Mountain.” Like Yahweh who is associated with the mountain of Sinai and 
later in eschatological traditions with Zion, so too El resides on a mountain. Other 
6Article from the Moorish Guide national edition 1928 “Islam is a very simple faith. It requires man to recognize his duties towards God Allah, his  
Creator and his fellow creatures. It teaches the supreme duty of living at peace with ones surrounding. It is preeminently the religion of peace…”  
PAGE 31 
patriarchal narratives attest the use of El Olam, “El the Eternal” to whom Abraham 
plants and worships a tree at Beersheba, El Elyon, “El the Most High,” the god of 
Melchizedek (Gen 14:18-24), and El Roi [Rey], “El who sees” (Gen 16:13).  
These various El epithets are associated with different shrines: El Shaddai 
with Bethel, El the Most High, the creator of the heavens and the earth, with 
Jerusalem, El the Eternal with Beersheba, El who sees with Beerlahai-roi, and El the 
god of Israel with Shechem. Many of these shrines and altars to El were established 
by the patriarchs themselves (e.g., Gen 21:33, 28:18, 33:20, 35:14). It has also been 
suggested that the name Yahweh might have originally been a cultural epithet of El! 
The etymology of  
Yahweh, yhwh, is still unclear, but one proposal is to see it as the causative imperfect 
of the Canaanite- 
Proto-Hebrew verb hwy, “to be.”  
It is probable therefore, as many commentators have contended, that the 
early Israelites actually worshiped El through his epithet ‘Yahweh.’ This process of 
assimilation is usually presented the other way around in the biblical literature: 
Yahweh is worshiped through the epithets of El: Shaddai, Olam, and Elyon.  
Contrary to these biblical traditions that suggest an assimilation between 
Yahweh and El, there are other passages that seem to indicate that Yahweh was a 
separate and independent deity within El’s council. Deuteronomy 32:8-9 is one of 
those rare biblical passages that seemingly preserves a vestige of an earlier period 
in proto-Israelite religion where El and Yahweh were still depicted as separate 
deities: Yahweh was merely one of the gods of El’s council! This tradition undeniably 
comes from older Canaanite lore.  
When the Most High (’elyôn) gave to the nations their inheritance, when he 
separated humanity, he fixed the boundaries of the peoples according to the number 
of divine beings. For Yahweh’s portion is his people, Jacob (Ya’cub) his allotted 
heritage.  
There are two points to take away from this passage. First, the passage 
presents an apparently older mythic theme that describes when the divine beings, 
PAGE 32 
that is each deity in the divine counsel, were assigned and allotted their own nation. 
Israel was the nation that Yahweh received. Second, Yahweh received his divine 
portion, Israel [is-ra-el or Isis Ra El], through an action initiated by the god El, here 
identifiable through his epithet “the Most High.” In other words, the passage depicts 
two gods: one, the Most High (El), is seen as assigning nations to the divine beings 
or gods (the Hebrew word is elohim, plural “gods”) in his council; the other, Yahweh, 
is depicted as receiving from the first god, the Most High, his particular allotment, 
namely the people of Israel. Similarly, in another older tradition now preserved in 
Numbers 21:29, the god Chemosh is assigned to the people of Moab.  
Other biblical passages reaffirm this archaic view of Yahweh as a god in El’s 
council. Psalm 82:1 speaks of the “assembly of El,” Psalm 29:1 enjoins “the sons of El” 
to worship Yahweh, and Psalm 89:6-7 lists Yahweh among El’s divine council.  
Thus there seems to be ample evidence in the biblical record to support the 
claim that as Yahweh become the supreme national deity of the Israelites, he began 
to usurp the imagery, epithets, and old cultural centers of the god El. This process of 
assimilation even morphed the linguistic meaning of the name El, which later came 
to mean simply “god,” so that Yahweh was then directly identified as ’el—thus 
Joshua 22:22: “the god of gods is Yahweh” (’el ’elohim yhwh).  
Noteworthy also is the fact that unlike the god Baal [Ba’ El or Bey], there is 
no polemic in the Bible against El, and all the old cultural centers of El, those in 
Jerusalem, Shechem, and Beersheba, were later accredited to Yahweh. Since the 
large majority of patriarchal narratives that speak of shrines and altars to El are 
found in the northern kingdom, such as Bethel and Shechem, and, on the other hand, 
many biblical texts seem to accredit Yahweh’s origin to the southern Negeb, the 
current scholarly hypothesis is that the worship of El in the north and of Yahweh in 
the south eventually merged. 7 Dang did we just get all that from the root MR, lol 
wow!  }

  On 
January 8th, 1886 in the state of North Carolina, the ushering in of the New Age was crowned 
with Allah’s Holy Prophet being manifested into human flesh. And the earth shook and the 
sky became dark and the people came out of the fields; for the reincarnating Spirit of Jesus was 
born into manifest, to save the Moors from the iron hand oppression, corporate 2nd class 
citizenship of the United States, who were governing a portion of Amexem at this time. By this 
act of Love Allah has distinguished to the Asiatics of the Americas with a particular favor; as 
he has given this distinction to other Nations (Sura 14:4) and (1Peter 2:4-10)This particular 
blessing was, the coming of a Prophet, a Messenger for they are a chosen generation a royal 
priesthood; a holy Nation. 
 The prophet was born Timothy Drew, little is known about his childhood. What is 
known is fragmented; it is told by our Moorish Elders that; Timothy Drew was born to a 
Cherokee Mother {one of the five civilized tribes of Moors} and his Father was an ex-slave. It 
was said that he was raised by his Cherokee family until 1892. Timothy moved to Newark New 
Jersey, and it is here in Newark were his Mother died. Timothy Drew went to live with an aunt. 
As the events unfold; she was a heartless forbidding woman, who tried to push him into a fire 
filled furnace and it was the Father God Allah who sheltered him from the fire. He is said to 
have scars from this incident. Young Timothy Drew left immediately after that and began 
traveling as a young teenager. It is told that young Timothy had uncanny abilities, these gifts 
from Allah most mistook as magic. These abilities landed him a job in the traveling circus, 
were he demonstrated levitation and clairvoyance abilities. During his international travels as 
a merchant seaman, young Timothy heard a voice speak to him with authority yet with a 
stillness and peace; “Go! Where You Go, I Go, I Am with You.” With his Heart guiding him 
he boarded a ship to the Mediterranean Sea. By the age of 15 or 16 Timothy Drew was in Africa, 
Egypt were his divine destiny, is to unfold as the African lotus unfolds on the Nile. Here he 
would live and be instructed, “…prepared divinely in due time by Allah…” He was recognized 
by an Adept Master Mind, a Guru who was said to have been from Punjab, India. Young 
Timothy was taken into the great pyramid Of Khufu with eyes bound, and was released to find 
his way out unassisted or die. They say at dawn he appeared from the sand in between the 
paws of Heru (Sphinx). After about 10 years of applied Adept sciences, he became the Light of 
Moorish Science; he was titled by the Adept Master Minds ‘Angel a Prophet of Allah’. After 
graduating all his degrees young Timothy was received in the Holy City of Mecca as a Moslem, 
one of the highest degrees the Chief Protectors of the Creed of Islam could give. Timothy Drew 
was exalted an given his holy Noble name wile in the Holy City of Mecca in Saudi Arabia El 
Hajj Sharif Abdul Ali and hajj was, in Mecca. Also he was known as Sheik Sharif Abdul Ali. 
El Hajj Sharif Abdul Ali at this time traveled. 
It is also reported around 1911-12 with his exulted authority he met and made alliances 
of Sultan Abdul Aziz Ibu Saud of the Holy City of Mecca, Sultan Fuad of Egypt and the Grand 
Lodge of England-France told. It is also reported he met one by the name of Sulaiman 
Mohammed and Abdul Karim El of Morocco. 
With a mighty Thought and consciousness of his 
mission to the sons of men, in the spring of 1912 
Noble Drew Ali returned to America to fulfill his 
duty as a Prophet. Allah’s Holy prophet was 
given many sacred books unfolding the creations 
of the worlds, the true history of Man, human, 
and mankind; he was taught the Laws that 
govern all events. He was enlightened to all the 
true teaching of all the Prophets of all the Ages 
and climes. He had placed to memory these 
divine books. “I got here just in time” the Prophet 
said that ‘the Europeans were looking for him 
with airplanes and with dread-naught’. When he 
came back into the United States he was asked 
“where are those books that you have?” The Holy 
prophet just smiled, he told the Moors that “the 
books were in his head.”  
The Holy Prophet as the rising Phoenix in the West arrives back in the states from the east; 
Noble Drew Ali helped establish The Canaanite Temple May 1, 1913 in Newark (NewArk) New 
Jersey (New Jerusalem).  
While in the United States the Holy Prophet started working as a Porter on the B&Q Railroad. 
As a porter Noble Drew Ali came in contact with an intelligent Mind, one J. A. Rogers and the 
Holy Prophet began to enlighten J. A. Rogers to his forefather’s divine history.  Soon after his 
divine meetings with the Prophet, J. A. Rogers wrote the book “From Superman to Man”. He 
gave honors to Noble Drew Ali cloaked under the pseudonym ‘Dixon’ a wise Negro porter. 
PAGE 41 
The Holy Kingdom of Ali was being manifested.  
Noble Drew Ali immediately started performing 
the duties of Allah’s holy Prophet; he met with 
soon to be President Woodrow Wilson; and they 
challenged him. Noble Drew Ali being a Prophet 
of Allah, rose up in the higher consciousness and 
spoke, and Light filled the room. “I have come for 
my people” and they asked him “Are you talking 
about the Negroes?” And the Holy Breath replied 
‘There is no Negros, Colored Folks, Black People 
or 
Ethiopians!! They are descendants of the Ancient 
Moabites, who inhabited the Northwest and 
Southwest Shores of Africa! I came for the flag of 
Our Ancient Forefathers.” President Wilson replied 
“It is not your time!” Ali answered ‘I have been 
appointed in due time by Allah the Great God of the 
Universe.’ And one of the President lawyers asked 
“What kind of flag is your flag?”  And Noble Drew Ali 
responded ‘You have it Hidden in Your Vaults!’ So they went to Philadelphia to the vault room, 
they began to bring out all kinds of modern day flags. The prophet stated ‘You know it is much 
older than these.’ They began to dig deeper still and up came a red flag, and they said “this is 
the flag of Morocco.” The Holy Prophet commanded ‘I Am!, here for the Moorish flag, that 
which you call the cherry tree.’ They dusted off a very old flag, a red flag with a five pointed 
green star in the center.( this event is also reported to 
have occurred March 7, 1912; thus Tag Day)  The 
European President and counsel stood in 
astonishment at the exactness of The Holy Prophet. 
The President said ‘We’ve had your people so long

Prophet stated ‘My flock knows my voice.’  
Noble Drew Ali left, and went about his 
Father’s business. May 1, 1916 he would

Divine and National Movement of North America was thereby established 
for the upliftment of fallen humanity.

railroad flats and homes of believers.

He was teaching the old time religion of the missing years of Jesus in the Bible.              
In 1919 he moved to New York where he joined Marcus Garvey’s 
Movement the UNIA; known as the African Prince. He also helps organize 
the Moorish Zionist Temple of the Moorish Jews. 
In 1924 The Prophet received a divine revelation to return to the state of 
his birth North Carolina, where he found articles needed for the success 
of his mission. He was Divinely Ordained; here he was given a vision of his 
mission. The Prophet began doing a mighty work proving that this is a 
new Era in time. And after fifty years of scientific achievements, man has 
just about reached the pinnacle of his physical knowledge and wisdom of 
our time, and he now is waiting to see what the new Era brings to the 
human race. And the rest as they say is history.

Notice the divine work of Prophet Noble Drew Ali; between the Moorish 
Jewish elders to the right, one can see the Moorish Zionist Temple of the 
Moorish Jewish flag, is the same as the state of Israel today. The Israeli, 
flag was commissioned on Oct. 28, 1948, although the Prophet and his co
founders of the Moorish Zionist Temple of the Moorish Jews had this flag 
as a national 28 years prior. We have not sent any Rasool except that he 
spoke the language of his own people, so that he could explain to them 
clearly.”

Days. 
PAGE 53 
74. So are all Moorish Americans Moslems? Ans. Yes 
75. And why is that? Ans. All Moorish Americans are Moslems, because Moorish 
Americans are the ‘Faithful’. 
76.  So do Moorish Moslems believe that there are other versions of Prophet Drew Ali?  
Ans. No!  
77. Why is that? Ans. The Divine recorded of Allah remembrance Book declared that 
after the death of all the true and divine Prophets of Allah; being that they are 
Thoughts of Allah manifested, some people had a greater need for a instead 
Prophet to return. A Prophet to appear on the scene. 
78. How is it then that there are so many now calling themselves reincarnated and 
resurrected prophets etc? Ans. Well they are following behind their father Satan 
the Beast who subscribes to himself the titles of God. There was one who was 
actually following the Prophets teachings. 
79. And who was this? Bro. John Given El the one whom some refer to as Saint John 
Given El. 
80. Why is this? Because of all others he remained spiritually and morally closer to 
what the Great Prophet of Allah did bring, after the death of Saint E. Mealy El that 
is. 
81. Why do you believe that so many are attempting to do this? Ans. Well that’s 
simple, after these ones have tried every other scheme which has fallen them the 
only one left is to refer to themselves as being the Prophet in order to draw the 
people to them. 
82. Then why do so many people fall for that trick? Ans. That answer is also easy to 
declare as we previously said that our people are under Mental Slavery. 
83. What does this sort of psychology produce a belief in? Ans. Spookism, which was 
given to our American fathers and mothers who were, forced into the religion of 
Satan the Beast. And so is far easier to mislead them than to lead them right. 
PAGE 54 
84. Why then do they accept such claims of men as Prophets? Ans. Because those who 
follow these sorts of claimers are themselves desires of such fame and titles. But 
they know that there is no truth in what they claim. 
85. And why do you say that they do know better? Ans. Once you have read the life 
works, and teachings of the Great Prophet of Ali; become a Prophet, when we 
Moors only recognize and follow the Divine Teachings of Prophet Drew Ali. Allah 
makes Prophets not Man. 
86. So what are you saying? Ans.  (a) That only Allah makes Prophets for us and Satan 
makes his own and so far not one of these claimers has declared that Allah 
Divinely ordained them, and from their own lip service we can see that they mostly 
depended on the European defined and has set up to become so-called Prophets. 
And other than that their membership depended on an even more mysterious rout 
to prove that these ones are prophets, and they seek to do so by reducing by raising 
87.  Do Moorish Moslems believe in reincarnation?  Ans. Yes we do.  But not in a 
carnal sense. We know that there is no such thing as reincarnation of a body 
already here, that is deemed possession and nor reincarnation of a body already 
here that is deem possession and not another man’s body.  When Jesus resurrected 
he did not come back as Peter or Paul. 
88. Do we Moors accept the Sovereignty Degree? Ans. No! 
89. And Why Not? Ans. Because the Holy Prophet did not bring it. Also the Great 
Prophet Drew Ali both told and instructed us Moslems not to be in the Europeans 
business and not allow him in ours, that we are a wheel within a wheel (Nation 
within Nation) and thus free to act. Ultimately Jesus long ago addressed the 
question about taxes, give to Allah what is Allah’s and render to Caesar what is 
Casers. This makes it very plain to us Moslems what we are to do. 
90. Is there any other support for your position? Ans. How do you expect to get 
freedom form a system that is built on your volunteer slavery and claims you to be 
Black. 
PAGE 55 
91. How does the Law affect us? Ans.  Its Constitutional as we are a Religious Body 
Politic, back in the constitutional fold of law. 
92. Have there been any lawful titles such as Supreme etc. 
And other titles given within the whole of the Moorish movement? Ans. Yes. 
93. Did our Great Prophet Drew Ali ever use the title Chief? Ans. Yes he did. Our 
Prophet Drew Ali did combine a few titles together for example the title Chief Head 
and Governor, or the title of Head leader etc. 
94. Why did the Prophet establish his organization under the Religious Corporation 
Act? ANS: Because Congress cannot make no law respecting an establishment of 
religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.  
95. Is everything a Moorish American Moslem does that is lawful apart of his religion? 
Ans.  Yes, If the Moorish American is wise. 
96. Is the Moorish Science Temple of America in a jurisdiction on to its own? Yes it is 
a Lawful Body Politic a nation within a nation. 
97. Are the Members apart of that jurisdiction? Yes those Members who uphold their 
covenants especially in Act. 6-7 and obey all the laws of the Holy Prophet Noble 
Drew Ali. 
98. What must a member know and have to prove he is apart and partial of said 
jurisdiction? Everything one does is under his/her religious right, and had

Historical Accounts of Noble Drew Ali’s Divine 
Acts between 1925-1929 
While the Honorable Marcus M. Garvey, the Forerunner of the Prophet was stirring up the 
nations and the Negros of America and the world over; and established himself as Provisional 
President of Africa, Noble Drew Ali, Allah Holy Prophet was establishing  himself in Chicago, 
In 1925, recorded in sealed historical  records ; 5th day of October 1925, that the first temple of 
Islam was established, the first Islamic Institution of higher learning in the west to propagate 
the faith of Mohammad in America , Temple #1 Chicago Ill . As he went through the land 
teaching this new doctrine of Salvation...” Oral tradition speaks on Noble Drew Ali reason for 
leaving Newark (New-Ark) New Jersey (New Jerusalem).  During World War I, the Moors 
refused to fight for the US government and were persecuted and harassed. Noble Drew Ali 
taught Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom and Justice not hate, under his religious right; he was 
driven out of the east coast by the police. Thus he set his roots in Chicago in 1925.   Towards 
the end of the year he goes to Washington D.C. to take possession of our flag and sign up to 
go a certain way in these United State of America. It is reported that around this time is when 
Prophet Drew Ali made his famous Star and Crescent prediction. In December 25, 1925 the 
Chicago Tribune proves the accuracy of the prophecy; the prediction was the star of Islam was 
in the West. The report by the Chicago Tribune stated “The symbol of Islam hung low in the 
western sky last night at sunset. The moon and the planet Venus were in conjunction, with 
Venus following the horns of the crescent moon. The figure of the crescent and star is one of 
the most beautiful sights of the heavens and is rather rare…” 
By 1925 the Prophet incorporated the Moorish Holy Temple of Science and began displaying 
the constitution and issuing the Divine Calling Card and founded the Moorish Manufacturing

Grand Sheik. As reported by the 
1st Supreme Grand Sheik E. Mealy 
El himself.   
“Returning 
from a trip visiting other temples, 
one morning in front of the 
Home Office at 3140 Indiana 
Avenue, the Prophet said to me, ‘E. Mealy El, Brother Mealy, you will study up now on all of 
my laws to prove yourself, because you will have to do what I am doing. You will go around to 
all temples and report back to me. So read up on my Koran, questionnaire, Constitution, and 
try to be perfect on all subjects, so you may act intelligent along all lines of procedure.’ Twenty 
minutes later, in his office on the same occasion, the Prophet Noble Drew Ali said to me ‘I find 
all of them want to sit in my seat, but at my absence, that is your station. Then when you leave, 
lock the desk and put the key in your pocket. Everyone wants to sit there, because that is where 
the money is, but I know who I want to sit there and I know who I want to handle my money.’.”

issues Nationality Cards, the Koran Questions for Moorish Children. The organization also

Testamentary qualities was being issued to the Governors. Allah’s holy prophet Noble Drew 
Ali conscious to the end of time and the fulfilling of the prophecies began demonstrating to

spoke 7 different languages, was the interpreter for the Holy Prophet at this conference. When 
the Holy Prophet ship was tied up at the dock, the Cuban army was standing on the dock, and 
Bro. Kirkman-Bey said something to them in Spanish, and the army came to attention, and 
PAGE 60 
then he and the Holy came down from the ship. At the conference Bro. C. Kirkman-Bey address 
the conference in both Spanish and Arabic, and when the Secretary of the United States heard 
Bro. Kirkman-Bey speak, he said “That’s a dangerous man.” 
Up to that period of time, the United States received a 50 year mandate for this land. At this 
conference, the mandate for this land was given to Prophet Noble Drew Ali. Bro. G. Cook-Bey 
G.S. (Emeritus) of Temple One said that the Prophet Noble Drew Ali showed us the mandate 
in the Adept Chamber. The conferences was mostly dealing with aliens within the jurisdiction 
of a country and Nationality issues; which is now established as international law as the 
‘Bustamante Codes’

January 11, 1928 Temple No. 6 was set aside by the Prophet Drew Ali at 8:00 o’ clock. 
Around this time before Julian Rosenthal bought the paper; The Chicago Defender, was a 
popular News Paper during the time of the Holy Prophet the paper began reporting on Prophet 
Noble Drew Ali.        
June 30th 1928 article entitled “Moorish Leader is Postmaster Generals 
Guest.” The article mentions Moorish delegates; Pearl Ali, Mealy El, and J. Smalls Bey.  
The Chicago Defender: July 14, 1928; “Moorish Leader Makes Plans for Conclave. 
Beginning Oct. 15 and continuing through the entire week the Moorish Science Temple 
America, of which Noble Drew Ali is founder and president, will hold its first general 
conference at Unity Hall, 3140 Indiana Ave Chicago Ill. President Ali began definite plans to 
this end upon his recent return from Pine Bluff, Ark., where he spent some days lecturing at 
the local Moorish Temple. This organization is playing a useful and definite part in advancing 
the sacred obligations of American citizenship. Indications are that this convention will be 
one of the most interesting ever held in this city. There will be delegates from 15 different states 
where local temples have been established. There will be an interesting event in which men 
and women members will were regalia similar to that worn in eastern countries. A camel will 
be presented during the session, specific reports of the general work and civil accomplishment 
of local temples. Report of the business enterprises that have been established in connection 
with these temples, such as grocery and market stores in Detroit, a laundry in Pittsburgh, Pa.. 
These examples of collective effort show that the member of the Moorish Temple and their 
leader have a sound economic program and  are blazing a trail and making the pathway over 
which our prosperity may travel unhampered and unafraid. ‘It must be kept in mind that no 
great movement can take definite shape in two years so as to be err proof,’ said President Ali. 
‘However, through accumulation experience each annual convention ought to witness a more 
perfect and wider functioning organization, representing the organized experience of men and 
women member throughout the country and possibly in time the world over’. And continuing, 
PAGE 63 
President Ali said ‘‘Constructive criticisms from sympathetic friends in and outside of our 
organization are welcome’.” In an article after the convention, we read that on the opening 
day that the two Grand Governors; T. Crumby Bey of Pittsburg and Lomax Bey of Detroit read 
reports, alderman Louis B. Anderson gave an opening address and others such as Oscar 
DePriest (Congressman and member), Attorney’s Aaron Payne (member), Richard Ross Bey 
(Sheik and member), Attorney George W. Blackwell, and Claude D. Green (managing editor 
of the Moorish Guide and chairman of the convention arrangements committee) spoke. A 
Moorish parade and the announcement of the Moorish governing council also held interest. 
About this the article states: “It is reported that the prophet, the Supreme Executive Authority, 
will appoint a supreme grand council, of which he will be the grand chairman. The Supreme 
Council will have power and control and supervise all the affairs and properties of the Moorish 
Science Temple of America, and it will become sole judge of what constitutes conduct injurious 
to the order, peace and interest or welfare with its constitution and by-laws, also the rules and 
regulations made by the prophet, and shall be the sole judge of the sufficiency of the evidence 
by which such conduct is shown. Prophet Noble Drew Ali is being congratulated by 
Chicagoans of the success of the Moors’ first annual convention and for his splendid work in 
promoting the cause of human brotherhood The name Moorish Temple of Science was 
changed to The Moorish Science Temple of America.’  
Saturday June 30th, 1928 the Chicago Defender reports “Moorish Leader is Postmaster Guest, 
among the prominent visitors to the Chicago post office this week were President Drew Ali, 
founder of the Moorish Science Temple of America… After a brief but pleasant visit with 
Postmaster Arthur C. Lueder… Afterwards President Ali expressed sincere appreciation for the 
courtesy shown him and his party by the postal authorities.”

because I, the Prophet, sent to redeem this nation from mental slavery which you now have; 
(We) need every one of you who think that your condition can be better. This is a field open to 
strong men and women to uplift the nation and take your affaires of men. If the European and 
other nations are helping me why not you? It is your problem. The “Negro” problems is being 
solved only as it can and that is by the Moorish National Divine Movement. If you have a

PROPHET MAKES PLEA TO NATION 
Friday, November 9, 1928  
Our Divine and National Movement stands 
for the specific grand principles of Love, Truth, 
Peace, Freedom, and Justice, and I the 
Prophet am applying to all loyal, faithful 
Moors, members and the American citizen to 
help me in my great uplifting acts of uplifting 
fallen humanity among the Asiatic race and 
nation. I have suffered much and severely in 
the past through misunderstanding of what 
the movement was dedicated to. 
 It is the 
Great God Allah, alone, that guides the 
destiny of this Divine and National Movement. I know all true American citizens are identified 
by national descent names to answer and apply to the free National Constitution of this free 
National Republic of the United States of America. That’s why I am calling on all true national 
citizens to help me morally and financially in my great work I am going to help this national 
government. F or without a free national name, a descent flag your forefathers, there is not a 
national divine title of the government in which we live.     
                                         
                                             –Prophet Noble Drew Ali- 
 
 
 
 
 
THE PROPHETS WARNING TO THE NATION 
FRIDAY, NOVERMBER 30, 1928 
The citizens of all free National Governments, according to their National Constitution, are 
all of one family bearing one free National name. Those who fail to recognize the free National 
name of their Constitutional Government are classed as undesirable, and are subject to all 
inferior names and abuses and mistreatments that the citizen cares to bestow upon them. And 
it is a sin for any group of people to violate the National Government; and cling to the names 
and principles that delude to slavery.  
I, the Prophet, was prepared by the Great God Allah, to warn my people to repent from their 
sinful ways, and go back to that state of mind to their forefathers’ Divine and National 
Principles- that they will be law abiders and receive their divine right as citizen according to 
the free national Constitution that was prepared for all free National being-they are to claim 
their own free National name and religion. 
There is but one issue for them to recognize by this Government and of the earth, and that 
comes only through the connection of the Moorish Divine National Movement and recognized 
by all other nations of the world. And through it they and their children can receive their divine 
rights, unmolested by other citizens. 
That they can cast a free National ballot to the polls under the free National Constitution of 
the United States Government, and not a “Granted Privilege” as has been the existing 
condition for many generations. 
PAGE 71 
You, who doubt whether I, the Prophet, and my principles are right for the redemption of my 
people, go to those that know the law in City Hall and among the officials in your government 
and ask them under intelligent tone and they will be glad to render you a favorable reply; for 
the are gold to see me bring you out of the darkness into light. 
Money does not make a man; it is free national standers and power that make a man and 
nation. The wealth of all National governments, gold d sliver commerce, belong to the citizen 
alone; and without your national citizenship y name and principle, you have no true wealth. 
And I am herby call on all true citizens that stand for a National  
Free Government and the enforcement of the Constitution to help me in my great missionary 
work, because I need all support from all true American of the United States of American 
citizen f the United States of America. Help me to save y people, who have fallen from the 
Constitutional laws f this government. I am depending on your support to get them back to 
hem Constitutional fold again, that they will learn to love, Truth, Peace, Freedom and Justice, 
support our free National Constitution of the united States of America. 
I love my people, and I desire their unity and mine back to their own free national and Divine 
Standard, because day by day they have been violation the National and Constitutional Laws 
of their government by calming names and principles that are constitutional. If Italians, Greek, 
English, Chinese, Turks and Arabians are forced to proclaim their free national name and 
religion before the Constitutional Government of the United States of America, it is no more 
than right that the law should be forced upon all American citizens alike. In all other 
governments, when a man is born and raise there and asked his name of national decent and 
name if he fails to give it is misused, imprisoned, or exiled. Any group of people who fail to 
answer up to the Constitutional Standards of Law by name principle, become to be a citizen 
of any government you must claim your National name descent. Because they place their trust 
upon issue and names that they are not a part and partial of, and nether were they formed by 
their forefathers. The word ‘Negro” deludes in Latin language to the word “nigger”; the same, 
the word “colored” deludes to anything that is painted, varnished, and dyed. /and every nation 
must bear a national descent name of their forefathers, because honoring thy father and thy 
mothers, your days will be lengthened upon this earth. These names have never been 
recognized by any true American citizens of this day. 
PAGE 72 
Through your free National name, you are known and recognized by all nations of the earth 
that are recognized by said national government in which they live. The 14th and 15th 
amendments brought the North and South in unity; placing the Southerner, which was at that 
time without power, with the Constitutional Body of power. And at that time, 1865, the free 
national Conational Law that was enforced since 1774 declared by the Free National 
Constitution to be free and equal, since that Constitution has never been changed, there is no 
need for the application of the 14th and 15th Amendments for the Salvation of our people and 
citizens. 
So, there isn’t but one supreme issue for my people to use to redeem that which was lost, and 
that is through the above statements, then the lion and the lamb can lie down to gather in 
yonder hills and neither will be harmed; because Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom and Justice will 
be reigning in this land. In those days the United Stated will be one of the greatest civilized 
and prosperous government of the world, but if the above principles are not carried out by the 
citizen and my people in this government, the worst is yet to come, because the Great God of 
the Universe is not pleased with the work that are being performed in North America by my 
people, and this great sin must be removed from the land to save it from enormous 
earthquakes, diseases, etc. 
And I, the Prophet, do herb believe that this administration of the government being more 
wisely prepared by more genus citizen that believe in their free National Constitution and 
Laws, and through the help of such classes of citizen, I, the Prophet, truly believe that my 
people will find the true and divine way of their forefathers, and learn to stop serving carnal 
customs and merely ideas of man, that have never done them any good- but has always 
harmed them. 
So I, the prophet, an hereby calling aloud, with a divine plea, to all true American citizens, to 
help me remove this great sin which has been committed and is being practiced b my people 
PAGE 73 
PAGE 74 
in the United States of America; because they know it is not the true and divine way, and 
without understanding they have fallen from the true light into utter darken of in, and there 
is no a nation on earth today that will recognize them socially, religiously politically, 
economically, etc, in their present condition of endearment , in which they them try to force 
upon a civilized world, They will not refrain from their sinful ways of action and their deeds 
have brought “Jim-Crowism,  segregation”  and everything that bring to human beings on 
earth. And they fought the Southerners for all these great misuses, but I have traveled in the 
South and have examined conditions there, and it I the work of my people continuously prating 
the things which bring dishonor, disgrace, and disrespect to any nation that lives the life. And 
I am hereby calling on all true American citizens for moral support and finance to help me in 
my great missionary work to bring my people out of darkness into marvelous light. 
                                              From THE PROPHET  
 
  
“Masterpiece of Religious Literature: Secrets of 
Other Creeds Revealed” 
By Prophet Noble Drew Ali 
Reprinted from the Moorish Guide of Friday, December 
1, 1928 
The Prophet Noble Drew Ali has spent many hours preparing 
the latest edition of the Koran, which will be a masterpiece of 
religious Literature. To Americanize the Oriental idea of Islam 
involves much change that is more or less negative to the aim 
purpose carefully considered with the idea to avoid changing 
the complexion of the original text. 
The Philosophy of the ancient Prophets is the main initiative in the compilation of the Koran. 
No thoughts of propaganda enter this work, as has been the case of many former religious 
work, such as the Bible and other books of creed. The sole purpose of the Prophet in giving 
such a message to the world is to save fallen humanity. When a compiler attempt to inject 
propaganda into a work of this kind, there arises a need to cover the true text in order to 
prevent a clash with the truth and ideas involved in such propaganda. 
Former work of this kind have ether hindered or helped the nations proportionately to the 
adherence to the truth and to the original purpose keeping the ignorant in such a state. It is 
hard to resist the temptation to use this medium for gain. Hence, many of the former treaties 
in works of this kind have been the means to foster ideas of the unscrupulous wherein they 
desire to use religious influence for gain. 
The many secrets known to the Prophet that could be used for the salvation of the nation were 
either let out or colored to an extent that their meaning was made void. Such is not the case 
with this edition n of the Koran. 
All the secrets of the ages known to man are put into this work. The secrets, known only to 
the Magi, are here revealed: the reading of the stars, the interoperation of marriage relations, 
PAGE 75 
the understanding of the span of life and other such as has been kept from the occidental world 
are in this book boldly brought out. 
The Koran, Americanized as it will be, can be bought in a few weeks. It will be sent to all 
Governors of The Moorish Science Temples of America. 
From the Prophet 
NOBLE DREW ALI 
 Many people are unaware of the importance of our Prophet’s action on this 
date in 1912 here in America. Others are unclear as to the reason for our usage 
of the same flag flown by Moroccans in Africa; Briefly it must be understood 
in the year of 1912 in the  month of March as a result of actions taken by 
European countries as well as the Sultan of morocco was stripped of its right 
to rule itself. With that came the removal of the Moroccan flag, this was then 
just a plain piece of red cloth. ] This can be verified in a flag book]. In the same 
month Prophet Noble Drew Ali went to Washington DC where he met with the 
President to reclaim our flag, the all red flag with a five pointed green star in 
the center; which was taken down during the colonial times. Because of the 
Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali’s action, Moors here in America were able to 
display with pride our ancient flag during the years when Moroccans could not 
1912-1956. Therefore March 17th is recognized as Moorish Tag Day, which 
celebrates the return of the five pointed green star to our flag here on U.S. soil, 
as the Moorish flag’s return to the world via Prophet Noble Drew Ali’s Divine 
work in America. Upon its independences in March 1956, the constitutional 
monarchy of Morocco adopted the red flag with the five pointed green star in 
the center as its National symbol of freedom and self-determination. 
PAGE 76 
After the traitors actions of Lomax Bey ex-Grand Governor and enemy to the Divine Creed 
and Un-loyal to the national Government U.S.A. to which the ….movement is to make men 
and women better citizens.   
“  
CHICAGO, ILL March 11, 1929 Brother Crumby-Bey the Governor and Chief Head of the 
Temple in Pittsburgh Pa. Brother Childs-Bey Governor and Chief Head of the Temple in 
Cleveland Ohio. These two Brothers are in power by the PROPHET to investigate business etc. 
of Temples number four in Detroit Michigan, because Lomax-Bey has violated all DIVINE 
LAWS of the PROPHET even before the prophet’s face, FEB. 15, 1929. He claims that the 
Prophet has no more power and the finance from Detroit would be in his charge. He wouldn’t 
send any to the Prophet.  
He Lomax Bey, with a loud voice said “Look at me! I will guide you through.” This is lawful 
and living evidence spoken before fifteen hounded (1,500) people and the Prophet was also 
present. 
“I, THE PROPHET, declare his Office vacant and the name of Grand Governor discharged. He 
can only be a member according to LAW because the Moorish Science Temple of America is a 
DIVINE ORGAINZATION. Each Temple is under Supreme Guidance of the Prophet. 
When man fails after being placed Head of the Temple by the Prophet of obeying our Divine 
laws and Constitution, he is a traitor and enemy to the Divine Creed and Un-loyal to the 
National Government U.S.A. to which the government is to make men and women better 
citizens.”

Excerpt from ‘The Moorish Guide’ Newspaper - 1929 A. D. 
‘The Moorish Guide’ enters the field of journalism with “Malice to none and charity to all”. It 
is not our purpose to disregard the Work of other splendid journals; it is not our purpose to 
fail to give due attention and space to all American citizens, individuals and organizations 
alike, who are working in their chosen fields of endeavor for the progress and development of 
all American citizens and all American Institutions. We hope to cooperate with them in the 
intensive and grueling battle for universal justice. ‘The Moorish Guide’ feels that ‘the greatest 
weapon’ in the hands of our group today in America is our press. The truth will never be told 
about a disadvantaged minority by the general press of any country, whether that minority be 
racial, political or religious. 
Unless we express ourselves through papers of our own the truth about us will not be told. 
Many of the beautiful things, many of the hopeful things and events which mark the progress 
of our group, will go unrecorded were it not for papers of our own. Our papers are our only 
hope of shoveling ourselves out from under the avalanche of lies that are annually let loose 
upon us. “A strong free press is the best possible safeguard of the liberties in general promotion 
and defense of the interests of strong, free people.” - Prophet Noble Drew ALI-

“the term ‘national of the United States’ means (A) a citizen of the United States, 
or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance 
to the United States.” Therefore, U.S. citizens are also U.S. nationals. Non-citizen 
nationality status refers only individuals who were born either in American Samoa or on 
PAGE 99 
Swains Island to parents who are not citizens of the United States.  The concept of dual 
nationality means that a person is a national of two countries at the same time. Each 
country has its own nationality laws based on its own policy. Persons may have dual 
nationality by automatic operation of different laws rather than by choice. For example, a 
child born in a foreign country to U.S. national parents may be both a U.S. national and a 
national of the country of birth. 
A U.S. national may acquire foreign nationality by marriage, or a person naturalized as a 
U.S. national may not lose the nationality of the country of birth. U.S. law does not 
mention dual nationality or require a person to choose one nationality or another. Also, a 
person who is automatically granted another nationality does not risk losing U.S. 
nationality. However, a person who acquires a foreign nationality by applying for it may 
lose U.S. nationality. In order to lose U.S. nationality, the law requires that the person 
must apply for the foreign nationality voluntarily, by free choice, and with the intention to 
give up U.S. nationality. 
Intent can be shown by the person's statements or conduct. The U.S. Government 
recognizes that dual nationality exists but does not encourage it as a matter of policy 
because of the problems it may cause. Claims of other countries on dual national U.S. 
nationals may conflict with U.S. law, and dual nationality may limit U.S. Government 
efforts to assist nationals abroad. The country where a dual national is located generally 
has a stronger claim to that person's allegiance. 
However, dual nationals owe allegiance to both the United States and the foreign country. 
They are required to obey the laws of both countries. Either country has the right to 
enforce its laws, particularly if the person later travels there. Most U.S. nationals, 
including dual nationals, must use a U.S. passport to enter and leave the United States. 
Dual nationals may also be required by the foreign country to use its passport to enter and 
leave that country. Use of the foreign passport does not endanger U.S. nationality. Most 
countries permit a person to renounce or otherwise lose nationality. 
Information on losing foreign nationality can be obtained from the foreign country's 
embassy and consulates in the United States. Americans can renounce U.S. nationality in 
the proper form at U.S. embassies and consulates abroad.

MOORISH JURISPRUDENCE 101 
PROPHET MAKES PLEA TO NATIONS 
Friday, November 9, 1928 
Our Divine and National Movement stands for the specific grand principles of Love, Truth, 
Peace, Freedom and Justice, and I The Prophet am applying to all loyal, faithful Moors, 
members, and the American citizens to help me in my great uplifting acts of uplifting fallen 
humanity among the Asiatic race and nation, for I have suffered much and severely in the 
past through misunderstanding of what the movement was dedicated to. It is the Great God 
Allah, alone that guides the destiny of this Divine and National Movement. I know all true 
American citizens are identified by national descent name to answer and apply to the free 
national constitution of this free National Republic of the United States of America. That’s 
why I am calling on all true national citizens to help me morally and financially in my great 
work; I am going to help this national government. For without a free national name a 
decent flag of your forefathers, there is not a national divine title of the government in which 
we live. 
Prophet Noble Dew Ali 
PAGE 109 
THE PROPHET’S WARNING TO THE NATION 
FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1928 
The citizens of all free national Governments, according to their National Constitution, are 
all of one family bearing one free National name. Those who fail to recognize the free 
national name of their Constitutional government are classed as undesirables, and are 
subject to all inferior names and abuses and mistreatments that the citizens care to bestow 
upon them. And it is a sin for any group of people to violates the national Constitutional 
Laws of a free National Government; and cling to the names and principles that delude to 
slavery. 
I, the Prophet, was prepared by the Great God, Allah to warn my people to repent from their 
sinful ways, and go back to that state of mind to their forefathers’ Divine and National 
Principles- that they will be law abiders and receive their divine right as citizens according 
to the free National Constitution that was prepared for all free national beings- they are to 
claim their own free National name and religion. 
There I but one issue for the to recognize by this Government and of the earth, and that 
comes only through the connection of the Moorish Divine National Movement which is 
incorporated in this government and recognized by all others Nations of the World. And 
through it, they and their children can receive their divine rights, unmolested by other 
citizens. 
That they can cast a free National ballot to the polls under the free National Constitution of 
the United States Government, and not under a “Granted Privilege” as has been the existing 
condition for many generation. You, who doubt whether I the Prophet, and my principles 
are right for the redemption of my people, go to those That know the law in City Hall and 
among the officials in your government and ask them under intelligent tone and they will 
be glad to render you a favorable reply; for they are glad to see me bring you out of the 
darkness into light. 
PAGE 110 
Money doesn’t make the man; it is free national standards and power that make a man and 
a nation. The wealth of all National Governments, gold and silver, commerce, belongs to 
the citizen alone; and without your national citizenship by name and principle, you have no 
true wealth. And I am hereby calling on all true citizens that stand for a National Free 
Government and the enforcement of the Constitution to help me in my great missionary 
work, because I need all support from all true American citizens of the United States of 
America. Help me to save my people, who have fallen from the Constitutional laws of this 
government. I am depending on your support to get them back to the Constitutional fold 
again, that they will learn to love-instead of hate and will live according to Love, Truth, 
Peace, Freedom and Justice, supporting our free National Constitution of the United States 
of America. 
I love my people, and I desire their Unity and mine back to their own free national and 
Divine Standard, because day by day they have been violating the national and 
Constitutional Laws of their government by claiming names and principles that are 
unconstitutional. If Italians, Greeks, English, Chinese, Turks, and Arabians are forced to 
proclaim their free national name and religion before the Constitutional Government of the 
United States of America, it is no more than right that the law should be forced upon all 
American citizens alike. In all other governments, when a man is born and raised there and 
asked his name of national descent and name if he fails to give it he is misused, imprisoned, 
exiled. Any group of people who fail to answer up to the Constitutional Standards of Law 
by name and principle, because to be a citizen of any government you must claim your 
National name descent. Because they place their trust upon issue and names that they are 
not a part and partial of, and neither were they formed by their forefathers  The word “Negro” 
deludes in Latin language to thee word “nigger”; the same the word “colored” deludes to 
anything that is painted, varnished, and dyed. And every nation must bear a national 
descent name of their fore-fathers, because honoring thy fathers and thy mothers, your days 
will be lengthened upon the earth. These names have never been recognized by any true 
American citizen of this day. 
Through your free National name, you are known and recognized by all nations of the earth 
that are recognized by said National government in which they live. The 14th and 15th 
PAGE 111 
amendments brought the North and in unity; placing the Southerners, which was at that 
time without power, with the Constitutional Body of Power. And at that time, 1865, the free 
National Constitutional Law that was enforced since 1774 declared by the Free National 
Constitution has never been changed, there is no need for the application of the 1th and 15th 
amendment for the Salvation of our people and citizens. 
So, there isn’t but one supreme issue for my people to use to redeem that which was lost, 
and that is through the above statement. Them the lion and lamb can lie down in yonder 
hills and neither will be harmed; because Lobe, Truth, Peace, Freedom and Justice will be 
reigning in this land. In those days the United States will be one of the greatest civilized and 
prosperous governments of the world, but if the above principles are not carried out by the 
citizens and my people in this government, the worst is yet to come, because the Great God 
of the Universe is not pleased with the works that are being performed in North America by 
my people, and this great sin must be removed from the land to save it from enormous 
earthquakes, diseases, etc. 
And I, the prophet, do hereby believe that this administration of the government being 
more wisely prepared by more genius citizens that believe in their free National 
Constitution and Laws and through the help of such classes of citizens, I the Prophet, truly 
believe that my people will find the true and dive way of their forefathers, and learn to stop 
serving carnal customs and merely ideas of man, that have never done them any good- but 
has always harmed them.  
So I, the prophet, am hereby calling aloud, with a divine plea, to all true American citizens, 
to help me remove this great sin which has been committed and is being practiced by my 
people in the United States of America; because they know it is not the true and divine way, 
and without understanding they have fallen from the true light into utter darkness of sin, 
and there is not a nation on earth today that will recognize them socially, religiously 
politically, economically, etc, in their present condition of endevorment, in which they 
themselves try to force upon a civilized world. They will not reframe from their sinful ways 
of action and their deeds have brought “Jim-Crowism”, segregation and everything that 
brings harm to a human being on earth. And they fought the Southerners for all these great 
misuses, but I have traveled in the South and have examined conditions there, and it is the 
PAGE 112 
work of my people continuously practicing the things which bring dishonor, disgrace, and 
disrespect to any notion that lives the life. And I am hereby calling on all true American 
citizens for moral support and finance to help me in my great missionary work to bring my 
people out of darkness into the marvelous light. 
From THE PROPHET 
The Voice of the Prophet 
If you have race pride and love your race, join the Moorish Science Temple of America and 
become a part of this Divine Movement. Then you will have power to redeem your race 
because you will know who you are and your forefathers were. Because where there is unity, 
there is strength. : “Together we stand, divided we fall.” 
Come, good people, because I, the Prophet, sent to redeem this nation from mental slavery, 
which you have now, need every one of you who think your condition can be better. This is 
a field held open men to strong men and women to uplift the nation and take your place in 
the affairs of men. 
If the European and other nations are helping me, why not you? It is your problem. The 
Negro problem is being solved only as it can, and that is by the Moorish Divine Movement. 
If you have a nation, you must have a free national name in order to be recognized by this 
nation as an American citizen. This is what was meant when it was said “Seek ye first the 
Kingdom of Heaven and all these things would be added unto you.” 
By the Prophet 
Prophet Warns All Moslems 
GOVERNORS ORDER TO READ PROCLAMATION AT EACH MEETING 
I hereby inform all members that they must end all radical agitating speeches while at work, 
in their homes or on the street. We are for Peace and not destruction. Stop flashing your 
cards at Europeans, it causes confusion. Remember your card is for your salvation. Failure 
to obey these orders will be of server consequence. We are for Love, Truth, Peace, and 
PAGE 113 
Freedom and when these principles are violated, Justice must take its course. Any member 
or group of members who hold malicious feelings towards the Temple or the Prophet, or 
violate the divine covenant of the Moorish Movement, will receive their reward from Allah 
for their unjust deeds. All true Moors will and must obey the Law as laid down to them by 
their Prophet. If they lose confidence in their Prophet they should turn in their card, button, 
cease wearing their Turban or Fez and return to the state where I, the Prophet, found you. 
This is a Holy and Divine Movement founded by the Prophet, Noble Drew Ali, and if the 
Prophet is not right the  
Temple is not right. The Prophet therefore is sending out a Divine plea to all Moorish 
Americans that they do their part in protecting their Prophet and the Temple. This is an 
everlasting movement founded by the Prophet through the will of Allah to redeem his 
people from their sins.

the times if slavery; but this is a new era of time now and all men now must proclaim their 
free national name to be recognized by the government in which they live and the nations 
of the earth; this is the reason why Allah the great God of the universe ordained Noble Drew 
Ali the prophet to redeem his people from their sinfully ways. The Moorish Americans are 
the descendants of the ancient Moabites whom inhabited the North Western and South 
Western shores of Africa.

your husband, take care of your children and look after the duties of your household, sons 
and daughters must obey father and mother and become industrious and become a part of

THE SCIENCE OF NATIONALITY 101 
ISLAM 
ALL PRAISE ARE DUE TO ALLAH  
HIGEST HONORS TO HIS PROPHET NOBLE DREW ALI, HONORS TO OUR FIRST SGS 
E. MEALY EL  
Allah’s Holy Prophet told E. Mealy El our first Supreme Grand Sheik appointed by the 
Prophet himself. ‘The Prophet told me dear Moslems.’ “I have put my law in your hand and 
my word in your mouth, and you are to tell them what to do, and they are to obey. 
Tell them my law hold up me before them. If you will hold me up before them, I will 
draw all men unto me.”  [RE: E. Mealy El’s state documents (see Moorish American Scholar 
Hist. fact on E. Mealy El 1929-1934)] 
The facts are: ‘There is only One Prophet and One Temple’; then why do we have all these 
sets and splinter groups calling themselves Moorish Science Temple of America etc.? It is 
obvious through observation and application that theses splinter groups do not know where 
the authority lies. We conclude that this is due to the lack of scientific study on the subject 
matter of Nationality, which our Prophet Noble Drew Ali said ‘is the order of the day’.   
There are too many belief systems with no facts to determine a right understanding, thus 
bringing about a misunderstanding of what the Holy Prophet established, and an idea that 
the Prophet did not fully establish all it takes to save us here in North America.  And this 
brings about a falsehood,(because of his demonstration from  1913-1929) and the mere ideas 
of man become paramount, in looking for redemption out of the state of being a 2nd class 
citizen, a corporation, statutory citizen, and debtor, person, Black, Colored Person, a Negro 
or African American, Latino, Hispanic ,Filipinos etc . 
In addition, the lower self-perpetuates this illusionary state of thinking.  ‘I can do 
my own thing, or thinking you can take a little of this Moorish Science (using the name Bey 
or El or the old Temple names established by the Prophet) and go out and do you with it. 
PAGE 124 
Startup little sects, clubs, 501(c) 3 corporations’ and call it a Temple.it Moorish Science this 
or that, so you can be the Man, get recognized, or play the hero.  You cannot do your own 
thing! 
HERE IS WHY. Primarily doing YOUR own thing is not what Allah’s Holy Prophet Noble 
Drew Ali established. When he came back he knew you had [and now have] mental slavery, 
caused from a European Psychology, that stagnated your progress, no knowledge of self, 
and therefore will remain a slave to everybody else.  Noble Drew Ali was not even doing his 
thing; being Allah’s holy prophet he was sent to bring us the everlasting gospel of Allah, 
(KQMA #40) and save us from the wrath of Allah, that awful day which is sure to come. 
Moreover, he did just that, and left his foot prints clearly cut for those of us to see which 
way he went. He kept the political complex answer to our collective problem wrapped up 
in the term ‘Nationality’ and secured it under Religion (check mate!!) for our in-depth 
research and made it the order of the day to show its priority for us to understand. 
NATIONALITY THE ORDER OF THE DAY 
Why is Nationality the order of the day? Has anyone ever answered or asked that question 
to their Sheik or better yet yourself? Good. 
The Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali and his divine Ministers of his cabinet gave out calling 
cards to the Asiatics of North America, which told us to… “Come all ye Asiastics and learn 
the Truth about your Nationality and Birthrights, because you are not colored, etc. And you 
must claim a free national name to be an American citizen…” Did you get your divine calling? 
This was the first document that one got from the Prophet or Sheik. If one would have read 
their calling, card and define the subject matter ‘nationality’ a lot of one’s own doubts would 
stop. 
PAGE 125 
“The time has come when every nation must worship under its own vine and fig 
tree” (MHK XLVII: 15) 
NATIONALITY 
[BLK’sLaw6th] Nationality: “that quality or character which arise from the fact of a person’s 
belonging to a nation or state. Nationality determines the political status especially with 
reference to allegiance; while domicile determines his civil status. Nationality arises ether by 
birth or naturalization.”   Nationality affords the state jurisdiction over the person and 
affords the person the protection of the state. The two most important parts of this particular 
definition to understand from a scientific eye is domicile and thee most important from 
these two are political status. 
Some facts about Nationality: 1.1 is a political status, 1.2 is defined by the Constitution, which 
is a political document. 1.3 Is synonymous with being a ‘national’ within statutory law. 1.4. 
Gives one the right to political association. 1.5 Gives one constitutional citizenship. 1.6 Is 
associated with a specific country. 1.7 Is called a ‘political citizen’ or a citizen of the United 
States in a political sense, by the courts to distinguish it from a STATUTORY citizen. See 
Powel v United States, 109 F.2d 147 (1940), Nationality therefore is the principle relationship 
that connects an individual to a state. Let us Look a Political Status and begin to connect 
the dots.  [BLK 6th p.1158] Political: pertaining or relating to the policy or the administration 
of government, state or national. Pertaining to or incidental to, the exercise of the functions 
vested in those charged with the conduct of government; of or pertaining to exercise of 
rights and privileges or the influence by which individuals of a state seek to determine or 
control its public policy; having to do with organization or action of individual parties. 
Political status gives one Political Rights.  Political Rights are those, which may be exercised 
in the formation or administration of the government. Rights of a citizen established or 
recognized by constitution (Act 6.) which gives them the power to participate directly or 
indirectly in the establishment or administration of government. The Holy Prophet was 
reported as saying, “I’m going to leave the European here just long enough to teach 
you how to run a government.” In addition, it all starts with understanding nationality. 
PAGE 126 
Nationality gives one Political Right’s within those political rights is the right of association 
to associate with your political community; the right to freedom of association and freedom 
from compelled association, (first Amendment to the Constitution). Association is the 
freedom to choose; choose  a domicile,(“…let the bonds of affection, therefore unite thee 
with thy brothers, that peace and happiness may dwell in thy father’s house and when 
ye separate in the world, remember the relation that bindeth you to love and unity; 
and prefer not a stranger before thy own blood.” HKofMSTofA XXV: 2-3) it is 
voluntarily entered into. Please at this stage pay very close attention….When you choose 
your associations (political community) which is determined by your ‘Domicile’  you have 
chosen your Civil Status  or Legal status. At this stage if one has proclaimed his nationality 
with the lawful government aka The Moorish Science Temple of America; Home Office of 
Noble Drew Ali, Chicago, Il USA and its lawful branch temples (Act 1. Additional Laws) and 
“…proclaimed their (your) free national name in the government in which you live and the 
nations of the earth…” you are a ‘National’… (We the People) well that is yet to be 
determined. Let us define a few more terms before we move on. Domicile: a person’s legal 
home. That place where a man has his true fixed, and permanent home and principal 
establishment, and to which whenever he is absent has the intention of returning. Smith v. 
Smith 206 Pa.Super.310, 213 A.2d 94. Generally. Physical presence within a state and the 
intention to make it one’s home are the request of establishing a ‘domicile’ therein. A person 
may have more than one residence but only one domicile. 
The legal domicile of a person is important since it rather than the actual resident 
often controls the jurisdiction of the taxing authorities and determines where a person may 
exercise the privileges/rights of voting and other legal rights and immunities. (Speaking on 
taxes for all you who are reluctant about taxes ...Being domicile and not nationality is what 
imputes a status under the tax code and a liability for tax. Tax liability is civil liability that 
attaches to civil statutory law, which attaches to a ‘person’ through their choice of domicile. 
{Your Per-Capita Tax Card is very important. To be able to prove you pay taxes to your 
lawful Civil government were your domiciled at,} (Those with eyes to see and ears to hear 
should be tuning in about their tax situation...Ask you are self-can they tax a Religious Body 
Politic. What about an agent [missionary] from that Body politic? [See 1099 form; ‘Our 
Authority’]) No one can force you to acquire or retain a domicile anywhere, including within 
PAGE 127 
the federal zone or to accept the civil status that attaches to it of statutory citizen (14th 
Amendment citizen) or resident. It is voluntary. Domicile determines your Civil and Legal 
and Statutory status. It does not determine your Political status or Nationality. Civil 
Status or Legal status: (Civil: originally pertaining to or appropriate to a member of a 
civitas or free political community; natural or proper to a citizen {National}. Also, relating 
to the community, or to the policy and government of the citizen and subject of a state.) 
Civil Status: gives you 1. The ability to contract with other parties including the 
government. 2. Politically and legally associate with groups you choose to associate with. 
*3. Choose or nominate the civil government that you want to protect your rights to life 
liberty and property...this is where your jury of peers is established, etc.3.1 choosing a 
domicile is an act of political association that has legal consequences in which you nominate 
a specific municipal government to protect your rights and property.[In others word the 
local governmental  laws that will govern you]  This is why the Declaration of Independence 
says that all just powers of government are derived from the consent of the people. Those 
who do not concede to a civil municipality have no civil protection or real Civil Rights you 
would be automatically   presumed to have a statutory citizenship status [14th Amendment 
citizen see Civiliter Mortuus or Civil Death]. Domicile is how you exercise rights 2 and 3. 
You can choose where your domicile is and you can change it at any time. 
When you choose a domicile, you elect or nominate a protector, which in turn gives 
rise to an obligation to pay for the civil protection demanded. The method of providing that 
protection is the civil laws of the municipal (as in county [Branch Temple]) jurisdiction that 
you chose a domicile within; ( Divine Constitution and By-Laws, Additional Laws, the 
Koran, General Laws, Supreme Laws, Rules, and Regulations, of the Prophet are the civil 
laws of the  Religious government (MSTof A))…Now what does it all mean? Well when one 
proclaims a Nationality their Political Status {political rights} is established (‘National’ of 
the United States of America,  Moorish American) giving you the choice to associate with a 
political community(Grand Temple, Grand Major Temples, Branch Temples) to establish 
your Civil Status/Legal Status your laws that will govern you. By your choice of 
Domicile ;( Home Office of Noble Drew Ali Chicago, Il) thus creating the political or 
constitutional and civil status of a human being. A  National a true American citizen of the 
United States of America the Republic. A Moorish American!  We The People,  
PAGE 128 
Let us go a little further. Nationality gives you your citizenship as a national, a 
constitutional citizen. Citizens are members of a political community who in their 
associated capacity, have established or submitted themselves to the dominion of a 
government. {The Religious Body Politic aka Moorish Science Temple of America.} By giving 
up some of their natural rights for the promotion of their general welfare and the protection 
of their individual as well as collective rights. Herriot v City of Seattle 81 Wash. 2d 48 500 P 
2nd 101, 109.  Citizen one who under the Constitution and laws of the United States of 
America or of a particular state, is a member of the political community owing  allegiance 
(allegiance is associated with Nationality allegiance is what makes one a citizen/subject of 
a country.)  And being entitled to the enjoyments of full Civil Rights. One’s full Civil Rights 
are enforced through municipal civil law, which in turn can only attach to ones choice of 
legal domicile. 
Now for those who believe that being a Private Individual or alien national is going 
to protect you because you got this status by way of paper work/ucc etc... You are the 
executor of such n such estate you have copied right to your name, you are power of attorney 
etc., etc., etc..  (You may be getting small reprievable remedies for now but).  When private 
individuals of one nation (states of the union) spread themselves through another as 
business or caprice may direct, mingling indiscriminately with the inhabitants of that other 
or when merchant vessels enter for the purpose of trade it would be inconvenient and 
dangerous to  society, and would subject the law to continuous infractions… if such 
Individual or merchant did not owe temporary and local allegiance and were not amenable 
to the jurisdiction of the country… the implied license, therefore under which They enter 
can never be construed to grant such exemption 7 Cranch 144. “…the implied license under 
which private individuals of another nation enter the territory and mingle indiscriminately 
with its inhabitants for purpose of business or pleasure can never be construed to grant to 
them an exemption from the jurisdiction of the country in which they are found. See also 
Carlisle v U.S. (1872)16 Wall. 147, 155 Radich v Hutchins (1877) 95 U.S. 210. 
So even if you have done all that paper work and think yourself untouchable…WAM
BAM ‘applied license’ all because you failed to see that The Moorish Science Temple of 
America (the correct one…there is but One) is the only soul foundation where the Asiatic 
PAGE 129 
of North America will find his/her salvation under! ..Now just because you failed to see does 
not mean defeat. You must be domiciled in your Political Community; a branch temple of 
the MSTof A (Act 1 Additional Laws) which is attached to The One Temple your domicile.  
All the fancy names, The Great Amexem such and such these great so called Orders 
of this and that all these sects and clubs, and 501(c) 3’s with Moorish this and that as your 
name. Your heart may be right looking for the salvation established by the Prophet Noble 
Drew Ali but your association is wrong. The facts are if you are not domiciled in your own 
municipality as a constitutional citizen; then no matter what you do. And this could be hard 
for some to swallow…You are subject to the civil laws that you were born (formed) in; and 
the only civil laws attached to a Negro is statutory civil laws of  a 14th Amendment citizen. 
Most Moors today have a birth certificate with the misnomer Negro as the 
nationality. Your birth certificates acts as your place of resident  (being over 18 legal age to 
consent  you freely made a choice to stay as a resident on record and registered , by way of 
your birth certificate in a federal zone)  that determines your civil laws that will govern you.  
All must see were the authority lies, and that’s with the Holy Prophet Noble Drew 
Ali sent from Allah to saves us from the wrath of Allah, period! The Prophets One Temple; 
known as the Moorish Science Temple of America. That is why he put his face on the 
documents. He is the seal, on the charter; he is the Moorish Science Temple of America and 
you cannot separate the two. Plus he had to put his face on the documents so we would 
know the real one, he is a prophet he saw all this coming… and even after he put his seal on 
all official records Laws, Regulations, Rules Organic Law, Koran (ecclesiastical and Secular 
laws) etc. still some choose to follow the so-called  reincarnated so-called Prophet. The  C. 
Kirckman Bey, Lomax Bey, the Dingel El’s, W.Frad Muhammad, German Bey, C. M. Bey etc. 
etc. etc.   And these are the facts. So you have today brothers and sisters thinking they can 
do, they own thing without the Prophet and his lawful succession. It’s not enough to just 
put his name in your documents, on web sites, have a bey or el attached to your acquired 
last name without properly; being part and parcel via-your Per Capita Tax Card, Dues card, 
Nationality and Identification Card for the Moorish Science Temple of America etc..  (And 
Birthrights for the Moorish Americans.) In the correct Temple.  Your Dues Card establishes 
your years in the Temple in your local municipal government by way of No. of Temple on 
the card and Domicile at Home office.  Per Capita Tax Card show you are paying tax to you

jurisdiction and numerates you as parcel and establish jurisdiction to your Body Politic. 
Study your Nationality and Identification Card it is all there too.   
RE: The Prophet‘s Warning To The Nations Friday, March 1, 1928; “Money (Notes) 
does not make the man; it is free national standards (Lawful Rights) and power 
(establish your own municipal government; (district Temple MSTA 43), the prophet 
left no stone unturned) that make a man and nation. The wealth of all National 
Governments, gold, silver (what creditor deal in), commerce, (Uniform Commercial 
Code) belongs to the citizen alone; and without your national citizenship by name 
and principle, (the holy and divine laws) you have no true wealth…” (Emphasis added).  
Question; when has a Negro ever been a citizen of the USA; I will tell you NEVER! 
(See Dread Scott case 1864) So what gives him/her the right to act as a citizen (1st class) in 
commerce? Doing business as a National (one who holds the credit of the nation)? Also 
clamming to be sovereign you went from a Negro to sovereign- oooBoy how you do that? 
By way of commerce? Ucc?  Were you had to be a true citizen to fully use that body of law… 
sounds fishy. Remember money does not make a man, money an interments used in 
commerce; its free national standards that make a man. A ‘Man’ you were 3/5 a man; free 
national standards are (Nationality and Divine Creed the two parts that were missing from 
your status to make you a Man/Human.)  Let us move on and conclude this academic.

National can also be described as a “citizen” when he/she is domiciled within the territorial 
and legislative jurisdiction of the Political Body to which one claims allegiance, being a 
‘National” is therefore an attribute and a prerequisite of being a citizen and the term can be 
used to describe ‘citizen.” 
“Any group of people who fail to answer up to the Constitutional Standards 
of Law by name and principle, (Surname and Law) because to be a citizen of any 
government you must claim your national name and descent.”

repent from their sinful ways, and go back to the state of mind of their forefathers’ 
divine and National Principles-that they will be law abiders and receive their divine 
rights as citizens according to the free national Constitution that was prepared for 
all free national beings, they are to claim their own free national name and religion. 
There is but one issue for the to be recognized by this Government (USA) and of the 
earth and that comes ONLY THROUGH the connection (in association with) of the 
Moorish Divine National Movement, which is incorporated in this government and 
recognized by all other Nations (States of the union also) of the world. And through 
it, they and their children can receive their divine rights (Political Rights, Real Civil

RFRA (Religious freedom and restoration Act) The supreme Court had found 
“exercise” to be burdened when laws interfere with a particular religious practice or

“Courts may not decide matters of church doctrine or governance.”(Cf. Kedroff v St. 
Nicholas Cathedral, 344 U.S. 94,116 (1952)) 
U.S. v Ballard (1944) The Courts found that neither neither the courts nor the government 
have the right to evaluate the religious beliefs of a citizen or group.  
*Waston v Jones, 80 U.S. (13 Wall) Courts may not interfere in matters of church doctrine, 
discipline or policy.  
[T]he First Amendment rest upon the premise that both religion and government can best 
work to achieve their lofty aims if each is left free from the other within it-respected sphere.

Missionaries Man or Woman piece it together can you not see your earthly and divine 
salvation the Holy Prophet Noble Drew Ali establish for us. Keep the Prophet out in front, 
because his was tried and true. It stands as a fact today!! And all this above come by way of 
your nationality, better yet you truly understanding Your Nationality.  
In conclusion  
I hope this academic brings Moor light to the importance of ‘KEEPING THE 
PROPHET OUT IN FRONT’ the jurisprudence thereof. My intention was not to offend any 
organization or group. We need not chase after the gods of Europe and mere ideas of man 
to save ourselves.  Allah’s holy Prophet got us! And that’s a fact! Some might need to as I 
did; to smash the [N]eg[r]o, (ego) and humble themselves and  
“Say not unto thyself, “Behold, truth breedeth hatred, and I will avoid it; 
dissimulation (to disguise ones intentions under a feigned appearance) raisheth 
friends, and I will follow it.” Are not the enemies, made by truth better than friends 
obtained by flattery?”  HKofMSTofA XLIII: 18

Amendment Slave Ship 101 
U.S. Law is Private Merchant Law, leaving the people as Surety and Debtor on the 
bankruptcy.  
Law is contract, universally and in the U.S., so we must follow the progression of 
contractual agreements which constitute the underlying U.S. Law. (We cannot address all 
individual laws and cases or you would not have time in a life to review it, even though 
ignorance of the millions of laws, statutes, codes, etc… is no excuse in Private Admiralty 
Jurisdictions.)  
In basically chronological order, the following progression of contracts, and our 
interpretation of them follows:  
1. 
The USA, a corporation of the English Crown, is bankrupt, and has been since at 
least 1788.  The Articles of Confederation states in Article 12: “All bills of credit emitted, 
monies borrowed, and debts contracted by, or under the authority of Congress, before the 
assembling of the United States, in pursuance of the present confederation, shall be 
deemed as considered a charge against the United States, for payment and satisfaction 
whereof the said United States, and the public faith are hereby solemnly pledged.”  The 
“Founding Fathers,” as constitutors, acknowledged and reorganized the debt in the US 
Constitution  
1787, Article VI, hence “constitution.”  Bankruptcy occurred on January 1, 1788 based on 21 
loans that the  
United States of America received from the King of England dating from February 28, 1778 
through July 5, 1782, the repayment of which had been ratified by Congress on January 22, 
1783.  The United States Bank, created in 1791, was a private bank, with 18,000 of 25,000 
shares owned by England.  
PAGE 136 
2. 
No de jure, constitutional Congress has existed since March 27, 1861 when seven (7) 
Southern States walked out of Congress leaving Congress without a quorum for adjourning 
and therefore ending sine die.  That which is called “Congress” today assembles and acts 
under the authority of the President acting in capacity of being Commander-In-Chief of 
the Armed Forces, under emergency war-powers rule, i.e. “law of necessity,” (see 12 Stat 
319, which has never been repealed and exists in Title 50 USC §§ 212, 213, 215, Appendix 16, 
26 CFR Chapter 1 § 303.1-6(a), and 31 CFR Chapter 5 § 500.701 Penalties).   
3. 
Since the above-referenced date, March 27, 1861, Americans have been under 
executive rule via presidential executive order under the aforementioned Emergency War 
Powers, 12 USC 95 a,  
b. Every “citizen of the United States” is now “legally” established as an “enemy” via 
the Amendatory Act of March 9, 1933, 48 Stat. 1, amending Trading with Enemy Act of 
October 6, 1917, H.R. 4960, Public Law No. 91.

December 6th, 1865, the 14th Amendment was proclaimed as ratified (even 
though it never properly was, see below).  The 14th Amendment, (which is private Roman 
Catholic Ecclesiastical Trust Law), constitutes a constructive, cestui que trust, a public 
charitable trust, “PCT,” that was expressly designed to bring every corporate franchise 
artificial person called a “citizen of the United States” into an inseparable merging with the 
government until the two are united (with the power inhering in the government, not the 
people).  A cestui que trust is fundamentally different from a regular trust, which is express 
in nature and consists of a contractual indenture involving three (3) parties: Grantor 
(Creator or Trustor {Prophet}), Trustee, {Sheiks} and Beneficiaries.{Members}  In an 
express trust,{fee-simple estate} legal ownership is transferred by written contract between 
Grantor and Trustee{Koran, Koran Questions for Moorish Americans, DC&By-Laws} in 
which the Grantor surrenders ownership of property to the legal person{Moorish 
American, Heir}, the Trust, to be managed by the Trustee on behalf of those who are to 
benefit from the arrangement, the Beneficiaries.  A cestui que trust, on the other hand, 
differs from an express trust in several crucial ways:  
a. 
It is not formed by express contract, i.e. overt agreement expressed in writing, but 
by legal construction.   
PAGE 137 
b. 
A cestui que trust has no Grantor, but, being a constructive trust created by 
operation of law, i.e., has only co-trustees and co‑beneficiaries.  The co-trustees are the 
parties with the duties for managing property for the “public good,” i.e. for the benefit of 
those designated as co‑beneficiaries.  
5.    The Legislative Act of February 21, 1871, Forty-first Congress, Session III, Chapter 
62, page 419, chartered a Federal company entitled “United States,” a/k/a “US Inc.,” a 
“Commercial Agency” originally designated as “Washington, D.C.,” in accordance with the 
so-called 14th Amendment, which the record indicates was never ratified (see Utah 
Supreme Court Cases, Dyett v Turner, (1968) 439 P2d 266, 267; State v Phillips, (1975) 540 
P 2d 936; as well as Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 448, 59 S. Ct. 972; 28 Tulane Law  
Review, 22; 11 South Carolina Law Quarterly 484; Congressional Record, June 13, 1967, pp. 
15641-15646).   
A “citizen of the United States” is a civilly dead entity operating as a co-trustee and co
beneficiary of the PCT, the constructive, cestui que trust of US Inc. under the 14th 
Amendment, which upholds the debt of the USA and US Inc. in Section 4.   
6. In conformity with the above-referenced creation of United States (1871) and the 14th 
Amendment, the Legislature of each State created a limited-liability corporation, 
chartered in a private, military, international, commercial, admiralty/maritime 
jurisdiction, entitled “STATE OF…” e.g. “STATE OF CALIFORNIA,” as evidenced by, 
inter alia, the change in the seal and the creation of a new constitution, e.g. 
Constitution of the State of California (1879), concerning which, re California:  
a. A general partnership agreement, hereinafter “General Partnership,” exists 
between the California Republic (1849), and STATE OF CALIFORNIA (1879), 
with STATE OF CALIFORNIA acting as governmental controller.  
b. STATE OF CALIFORNIA now acts as an agent/instrumentality of United States, 
collecting whole life insurance premiums, known as “taxes,” for the International 
Monetary Fund, based, inter alia, upon the Limited Liability Act of 1851 and the 
bankruptcy of United States of 1933, (see House Joint Resolution 192 of June 5, 
1933; Public Law 73-10; Perry v. U.S. (1935), 294 U.S. 330-381, 79 L Ed 912; 31 USC 
5112, 5119).  
PAGE 138 
7. Inasmuch as all law is contract, the contract involved in a constructive trust is an 
implied contract.   
An implied contract can be ratified by two (2) means:  
a. Acquiescence by silence, i.e. the “government” asserts its intentions concerning 
your life, rights, and property and you assent, don’t rebut, and compliantly go 
along with what they claim.  In 1871 the Government changed the nature of its 
contract with the people from law as defined by the original Constitution of 1787 
that recognizes law (common law), admiralty (on the sea only), and equity 
(functioning by voluntary contract between all participating parties), and began 
relating to people as if they were “citizens of the Unites States” within/under the 
private, commercial, international, military jurisdiction of the new de facto 
corporation, i.e. US Inc.  They offered people a “new deal,” and almost everyone 
bought it (based on naïve and foolish trust and assuming that everything was 
OK).  
The people were thereby denied access to law and placed on the ship of state of 
US Inc. where the captain’s word is law and no one has any rights.  As Jefferson phrased 
the matter, “As government grows, liberty recedes.”  
b. You expressly accept “benefits” offered by the government, and thereby finalize 
the contract by deed.  This is similar to finalizing a contract with a restaurant by 
sitting down at a table, reading a menu, and then ordering and consuming a 
meal.  By your deeds you affirm to the restaurant that you will pay for the meal 
in accordance with the price stated on the menu.  No written contract is signed, 
but a contract is formed nevertheless.   
8. By the above two (2) means people give implied assent that they are bound by an 
alleged contract with US Inc. in accordance with the terms and conditions that inhere 
in being treated as a “citizen of the United States” under the 14th Amendment, and are 
therefore placed into permanent legal status as a Debtor and Surety for U.S. Inc..  In 
such a position, people leave the ground of sovereignty and all capacity for asserting 
their unalienable rights in favor of being presumed as having exercised their 
sovereignty and free-will autonomy for the purpose of going along with the 
PAGE 139 
government’s assertion that they sacrifice everything for the “public good,” (i.e. the 
PCT).  By so doing people lose their standing in law, (i.e. they “die a civil death in the 
law.”)  They are placed in the legal position of mortmain (i.e. as if deceased) and are 
shorn of capacity for asserting their rights, since the presumption is that they have 
already exercised those rights for the purpose of being placed in the position they are 
in, i.e. property of the government with a lien against you and everything your life labor 
could ever create, including your children.  The private being (the real individual) is 
sacrificed for the good of the public (the imaginary collective).  
9. When people die such a civil death (i.e. Black people, African Americans, Latinos etc.) 
in the law they are like ghosts, and thereby incapable of managing their own affairs and 
enjoying their unalienable rights.  Like the estate of a decedent, they are then managed 
by the executors/administrators of the estate, in probate.  Such is the condition of every 
“citizen of the United States” today in law, managed by the government agencies acting 
as executors/administrators of their estates in bankruptcy, legal incapacity, and civil 
death as assets of the bankrupt US.  The US is property of the private Real Parties of 
Interest, the Creditors in bankruptcy.  
10. The 14th Amendment was allegedly established for the purpose of creating a citizenship 
for the liberated blacks (so-called), and other disenfranchised people, who otherwise 
had no citizenship because they could not comply with the requirements for state 
citizenship. (i.e. Nationality, and Divine Creed{ Also they have no state government 
which comes from  ones nation; in other words ones origins. With no state they are in 
effect stateless persons there is no one there to protect their rights as a human being, 
etc.)  What actually happened was that the blacks were taken off of the Southern slave 
plantations and placed into the slave plantation of US Inc., a far worse lot.  The 
government then gradually absorbed everyone else — including state citizens — into 
the same condition.  
.  The conspiratorial nature of matters is exemplified in comments by one of the major 
actors in the triumph of the Federal Reserve, Edward Mandell House, who had this to say 
in a private meeting with President Woodrow Wilson:  
PAGE 140 
“[Very] soon, every American will be required to register their biological property in a 
national system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient 
system of pledging.  By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, 
which will affect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency.  Every American 
will be forced to register or suffer being able to work and earn a living.  They will be our 
chattel, and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation of the law 
merchant under the scheme of secured transactions.  Americans, by unknowingly or 
unwittingly delivering the bills of lading to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent, forever 
to remain economic slaves through taxation, secured by their pledges.  They will be stripped 
of their rights and given a commercial value designed to make us a profit and they will be 
none the wiser, for not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and, if by accident 
one or two should figure it out, we have in our arsenal plausible deniability.  After all, this is 
the only logical way to fund government, by floating liens and debt to the registrants in the 
form of benefits and privileges.  This will inevitably reap to us huge profits beyond our wildest 
expectations and leave every American a contributor to this fraud which we will call “Social 
Insurance.”  Without realizing it, every American will insure us for any loss we may incur 
and in this manner, every American will unknowingly be our servant, however begrudgingly.  
The people will become helpless and without any hope for their redemption and, we will 
employ the high office of the President of our dummy corporation to foment this plot against 
America.”

traditional definition of international law, a state had to be sovereign: It needed a

2. As to the person who compose the 
body politic (Members) they take collectively the name, of people, or nation (Moorish 
American, Bey or El= nationality, free national name and descent name=family name or Sur

rights [Nationality], and subjects as being submitted to the laws of the state [Moorish Science 
Temple of America]. BLK4th edition: Body Politic: a nation or state; the People of a nation 
or Society considered as an organized group of citizens.  
Another important distinction needs to be made: The help the Prophet gave to the 
national government was legitimacy. Before the Prophet  
Drew Ali’s great work, the United States was not considered to be a nation in the sense of 
international law and was ruled on by the Supreme Court in 1794 in the case of Chrisholm v. 
Georgia, 2 Dall. (U.S.) 419, 1 L. Ed. 440 (1793). United States the country is a ‘society’ and 
‘sovereignty’ but not a “nation” under the laws of nations by the supreme courts own 
admission. Thus we became a true nation under God when the prophet wrapped the Moorish 
Flag around the little Moorish girl and the American Flag around the little Moorish boy at the 
Convention of 1928. “…I made you a nation within a nation the wheel within the wheel…” 
Prophet Drew Ali. Thus the Moorish Science Temple of America- Divine and National 
Movement is the National Government of the National Republic of the United State of America.  
12 Power: means n. 1. The ability or capacity to perform or act effectively. Political or 
national strength (resources minerals, precocious metals), the ability to do an act. HKMSTA:

to redeem a person from captivity by paying a stipulated price, or to redeem from sin by

element of autonomy or self-government, that is, the independence of the community as a 
whole from the interference of any foreign power in its affairs or any subjection to such 
power, it is further necessary to the constitution of a nation that it should be an organized 
jural society, that is, both governing its own members by regular laws, and defining and 
protecting their rights, and respecting the rights and duties which attach to it as a 
constituent member of the family of nations.

National vs Federal  
The two political jurisdictions/nations within the United States* 
Another important distinction needs to be made.  Definition 1 above refers to the country 
“United States*”, but this country is not a “nation”, in the sense of international law.  This 
very important point was made clear by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1794 in the case of 
Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. (U.S.) 419, 1 L.Ed. 440 (1793) , when it said: 
This is a case of uncommon magnitude. One of the parties to it is a State; certainly 
respectable, claiming to be sovereign. The question to be determined is, whether this State, 
so respectable, and whose claim soars so high, is amenable to the jurisdiction of the 
Supreme Court of the United States? This question, important in itself, will depend on 
others, more important still; and, may, perhaps, be ultimately resolved into one, no less 
radical than this 'do the people of the United States form a Nation?' A cause so conspicuous 
and interesting, should be carefully and accurately viewed from every possible point of sight. 
I shall examine it; 1st. By the principles of general jurisprudence. 2nd. by the laws and 
practice of particular States and Kingdoms. From the law of nations little or no illustration 
of this subject can be expected. By that law the several States and Governments spread over 
our globe, are considered as forming a society, not a NATION. It has only been by a very 
few comprehensive minds, such as those of Elizabeth and the Fourth Henry, that this last 
great idea has been even contemplated. 3rdly. and chiefly, I shall examine the important 
question before us, by the Constitution of the United States, and the legitimate result of 
that valuable instrument. [Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. (U.S.) 419, 1 L.Ed. 440 (1793)]. 
PAGE 148 
An earlier edition of Black’s Law Dictionary further clarifies the distinction between a 
“nation” and a “society” by clarifying the differences between a national government and a 
federal government, and keep in mind that the American government is called “federal 
government”:  
“NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.  The government of a whole nation, as distinguished from 
that of a local or territorial division of the nation, and also as distinguished from that of a 
league or confederation.  
“A National Government is a government of the people of a single state or nation, united 
as a community by what is termed the “social compact,’ and possessing complete and 
perfect supremacy over persons and things, so far as they can be made the lawful objects of 
civil government.  
A Federal Government is distinguished from a national government by it being the 
government of a community of independent and sovereign states, united by compact.”  
Piqua Branch Bank v. Knoup, 6 Ohio.St. 393.” [Black’s Law Dictionary, Revised Fourth 
Edition, 1968, p. 1176] 
“FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. The system of government administered in a state formed by 
the union or 
Confederation of several independent or quasi-independent states; also the composite state 
so formed.  
In 
strict 
usage, there is a distinction between a confederation and a federal government. The former 
term denotes a league or permanent alliance between several states, each of which is fully 
sovereign and independent, and each of which retains its full dignity, organization, and 
sovereignty, though yielding to the central authority a controlling power for a few limited 
purposes, such as external and diplomatic relations. In this case, the component states are 
the units, with respect to the confederation, and the central government acts upon them, 
not upon the individual citizens. 
In a federal government, on the other hand, the allied states form a union,-not, indeed, to 
such an extent as to destroy their separate organization or deprive them of quasi sovereignty 
with respect to the administration of their purely local concerns, but so that the central 
power is erected into a true state or nation, possessing sovereignty both external and 
internal,-while the administration of national affairs is directed, and its effects felt, not by 
the separate states deliberating as units, but by the people of all. In their collective capacity, 
as citizens of the nation. The distinction is expressed, by the German writers, by the use of 
the two words "Staatenbund" and "Bundesstaut;" the former denoting a league or 
confederation of states, and the latter a federal government, or state formed by means of a 
league or confederation.” [Black’s Law Dictionary, Revised Fourth Edition, 1968, p. 740]  
PAGE 149 
So the “United States*” the country is a “society” and a “sovereignty” but not a “nation” 
under the law of nations, by the Supreme Court’s own admission.  Because the Supreme 
Court has ruled on this matter, it is now incumbent upon each of us to always remember it 
and to apply it in all of our dealings with the Federal Government.  If not, we lose our 
individual Sovereignty by default and the Federal Government assumes jurisdiction over us.   
An Asiatic who is a“ 14th Amendment citizen” ( One who has not proclaimed his/her 
nationality with the lawful Moorish Science Temple of America is called a statutory “U.S. 
citizen” under 8 U.S.C. §1401, and he is treated in law as occupying a place not protected by 
the Bill of Rights, which is the first ten amendments of the United States Constitution.
