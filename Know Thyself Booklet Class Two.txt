CREED” 
Class 2 /  2nd  Month /Topic: “Psychology & Thinking” 
Methodology: Introduction to the subject . ‘KNOW THY SELF’:  Scito te ipsu {Saa-toe-tee-ip-sum] – This phrase is a 
concise and precise translation of “Know Thyself” in [MR] Latin. It follows the imperative mood and uses the verb “scito” 
meaning “know” or “learn.” The reflexive pronoun “te” means “thyself,” conveying the self-reflective aspect of the original 
quote. 
Goals: To Understand: the process of thinking; What ‘Higher & Lower Self’ means. Definition(s). 
CHAPTER ONE:  
HIGHERSELF & LOWERSELF 
The science of the Know Thy Self is the study and understanding of the nature of the self [the Body] and its 
relationship with the consciousness of Man or the Soul of Man [Mind], the psychology of Truth and Falsehood 
strangely mixed. How to better comprehend this relationship to bring the selves into harmony or Peace. 
HKMSTA1 CHAPTER III  
THE DIVINE INSTRUCTIONS 
ELIHU'S LESSONS-THE UNITY OF LIFE 
1. Again Elihu met his pupils in the sacred grove and said: 
2. "No man live unto himself, for every living thing is bound by cords to every other living thing. 
3. Blessed are the pure in heart; for they will love and not demand love in return. 
4. They will not do to other men what they would not have other men do unto them. 
5. There are two self’s; the higher and lower self. 
6. The higher self is human spirit clothed with soul, made in the form of Allah2. 
7. The lower self, the carnal self, the body of desires, is a reflection of higher self, distorted by the murky 
ethers of the flesh. 
8. The lower self is an illusion and will pass away; the higher self is Allah in man and will not pass away. 
9. The higher self is the embodiment of truth; the lower self is truth reversed and so is falsehood manifest. 
10. The higher self is justice, mercy, love and right; the lower self is what the higher self is not. 
1Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America; ecclesiastical and secular laws for Moslems; prepared by the Noble Prophet Drew Ali. 1927AD 
2Translation into English from Arabic: Great God. 
11. The lower self-breeds hatred, slander, lewdness, murder, theft, and everything that harms, the higher self 
is mother of the virtues and the harmonies of life. 
12. The lower self is rich in promises, but poor in blessedness and peace; it offers pleasure, joy and satisfying 
gain; but gives unrest, misery, and death. 
13. It gives men apples that are lovely to the eye and pleasant to the smell; their cores are full of bitterness 
and gall. 
14. If you would ask me what to study, I would say, yourselves and you well have studied them; and then 
would ask me what to study next, I would reply, yourselves. 
15. He who knows well his lower self, knows the illusions of the world, knows of the things that pass away; 
and he who knows his higher self, knows Allah; knows well the things that cannot pass away. 
16. Thrice blessed is the man who has made purity and love his very own; he has been ransomed from the 
perils of the lower self and is himself his higher self. 
17. Men seek salvation from an evil that deems a living monster of the nether world; and they have gods that 
are but demons in dis- guise all powerful, yet full of jealousy and hate and lust. 
18. Whose favors must be bought with costly sacrifice of fruits and of the lives of birds and animals and 
humankind. 
19. And yet these gods possess no ears to hear, no eyes to see, no heart to sympathize, no power to save. 
20. This evil is a myth; these gods are made of air and clothed with the shadow of a thought. 
21. The only devil from which man must be redeemed is self the lower self. If man would find his devil 
he must look within; his name is self. 
22. If man would find his savior he must look within; and when the demon self has been dethroned the 
savior, love, will be exalted to the throne of power. 
23. The David of the light is purity, who slays the strong Goliath of the dark, and seats the savior, love, upon 
the throne." 
In acknowledging self,  the purpose is to reach a state of perfection of self or Peace with self and 
with others and environment and God, bringing about a state of happiness and prosperity or peace of mind 
coexisting in true civilization. Or simply to improve oneself in Love. This is accomplished by acknowledging 
the weakness within our character and having the determination to do something about it. To slay the devil 
and demon self cumbersome personalities. 
We are instructed from Professor Drew Ali3 to look within, if we want to find our savior in life or the 
devil in our life and use the light of Purity to slay any unseemly overpowering obstacle that may come in our 
3Prophet Noble Drew Ali; Angel of the GREAT GOD.

aliveness; is to use the attributes of Love that will purify any carnal4, ungodly, or ignorant behavior in one’s 
functional activities, to reach the exalted Throne of power in life. 
Growing up in this contemporary society most were taught a belief that one’s savior was someone 
outside of themselves or a or thee Devil was outside of themselves; yes there are people who have developed 
lower self-characteristics that we can say that person is the devil or a group of people having those 
attributes and behaviors of the lower-self, can be considered a synagogue of Satan like people. 
Also, a person or people can develop the high attributes of the Higher Self and we consider them god
like, prophetic and hold them in high esteem and honor such benevolence and aspire to achieve such high 
and lofty aims in our life, of an exemplified personality such as theirs5. And becoming a god-like people made 
in His image and likeness. 
This may be easier said than done. Uplifting ourselves out of mental slavery. This is because of the nature 
of the Body (Lower-self); what do I mean? Let’s peel this back layer by layer. 
When the lower self is faced with new information that is contrary to its [your] current belief system and is 
challenged and your behavior under your belief system  is inconsistent and contradictory to the truth of the 
new information; it can trigger an episodic reaction of incomprehensible communication and highly emotional 
irrational behavior; that usually comes out as fear, denial, anger, and  confrontational, inconstancy, 
weakness, misery, lying, feeling awkward, or embarrassment. This is known as Cognitive Dissonance. To 
understand it better; see it like, one rejects new information if it challenges their old beliefs [habits], even 
if those habits and beliefs are detrimental to their living. 
Have you noticed that people often like to stick to consistent habits and routines that are popular or 
culturally accepted to maintain order within their lives within the status quo? These habits may include 
everyday activities like preferring a specific seat during their daily commute or eating meals at consistent 
times; or being raised in a social class order ignorantly conforming to that order because of habits pasted 
down from inherited belief systems. Disturbance to this order can lead to mental unease, which may manifest 
in altered thought processes[alter-ego’s] or beliefs and cause [hyperlink(s)} spatial navigation: episodic 
autonomic nervous reactions6 that can be detrimental to one’s life.  
A means of alleviating this conflict is by adjusting either your actions or Habits, and beliefs with truth, 
to restore consistency within self. Cognitive dissonance can become a fact when individuals mostly move 
4Carnal means relating to the physical and especially sexual appetites that can be considered to be immoral , or worldly feelings and wants of the body. Animal nature and lascivious, 
lustful, libidinous fleshly behavior. 
5E.g. Ali, Mohammed, Jesus, Buddha, and  Confucius [Peace and blessing be upon them]  
6The autonomic nervous system is a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates bodily functions, such as the heart rate, its force of contraction, digestion, respiratory 
rate, pupillary response, urination, and sexual arousal. This system is the primary mechanism in control of the fight-or-flight response.[ also called Going Off, Going-Ham, Flashing, etc.].

off, of here-say and stay only in belief, never moving up to faith which is to know and can never enjoy the 
fullness of fruition. 
You can look at it like a reprograming of your basic operating system or an upgrade. First, we 
must run virus software(s) and get rid of any viruses to our system [our mind]. [ things that are contrary 
to the truth and prosperity, happiness] . 
The number One virus in an individual’s operating system is the virus ‘Carnality’ and its myriad of 
attributes. These attributes lie not in the sexual organs nor your hands, mouth, feet, not in the make up on 
your face, or the masks you wore, not the outward show case to idol for all to applaud. “...If man would find 
his savior, he must look within...”. “...If man would find his devil he must look within; his name is self”. 
Looking within: The seat of the lower-self and the Throne of the Higher-self where the conflict & battle7 
takes place, is in your head- where 95% of individuals problems are. 
In Science it is the Brain. The exact part is the Limbic system seat of the Animal nature. 
7The true Jihad 
3 
An important part of this puzzle in reprograming your operating system is the “Basic Operating System” or the BOS. And  
how the BOS became the BOS, is the initial 
input data when     
we were children. (1-11).

especially if that memory was 
established through Trauma! Traumatized memory is the strongest memory. They 
are firmly rooted in the hippocampus. And most individuals suffer from childhood 
trauma. E.g., the lack of a Nuclear Family, an environment riddled with ignorance, 
discrimination and violence, also sexual overstimulation and lack of morality, and 
extreme materialism. And it is these unchecked memories that shape our current 
reality for good or bad, and can cause negative spatial navigation [episodic nervous 
reaction that can ruin relationships],  
with 
first 
energy 
In confronting these memories, that were established through trauma, the 
Lower-self will try to deflected you away from the reality of the trauma, because its 
job is to keep you safe from real danger or imaginary fear; and it will fight with denial 
until the pressure of Truth is applied and it has no were to go, other than acceptance. 
After acceptance, is Reflection, then the process of Upgrading takes place: you willingly 
start to apply the instruction of Truth. SET THE TRUTH TO MEMORY.

CHAPTER TWO: 
KNOW THY ADVERSARY! 
In understanding the lower self, we see its attributes in the following 
descriptions: 
A. The lower self, the carnal self, the body of desires. 
B.  The lower self-breeds hatred, slander, lewdness, murder, theft, and 
everything that harms ...” 
C.  The lower self is rich in promises, but poor in blessedness and peace; it offers 
pleasure, joy and satisfying gain; but gives unrest, misery, and death. 
D.  It gives men apples that are lovely to the eye and pleasant to the smell; their 
cores are full of bitterness and gall. 
These defects of character take form in an individual’s personality as: the SIX  DEADLY 
FOES & the 13-CARNAL SINS 
SIX DEADLY FOES: 
1. Instability,   2. 
Inconstancy, 3 Weakness  4. Insufficiency of Knowledge, 5 
Misery,  6. Irresolution                               
The 13 Carnal SINS of One’s Nature: 
1. Vanity,  2. Lying,  3. Theft,  4. Fear,  5. Selfishness,  6. Hatred.  7. Harm-everything 
that harms,  
8. Greed, 9. Ignorance,  10. Slander,  11. Lewdness,  12. Murder,  13. Jealousy. 
These are the viruses within an individual’s operating system; if at any time you 
have experienced these symptoms, well its okay, to have once experienced a few lesser 
viruses; the problems arise when those viruses infect and multiply and morph into 
6 
more complex issue until the entire body is infected and you have the full manifestation 
of Satan. 
The Software used to eradicate any virous in any operating system used is Love and 
the attributes of Love. What do I mean? Well Love’s first expression is Truth and it’s 
this embodiment of Truth that will eradicate those viruses! The Viruses will put up a 
fight and this is when the Truth and falsehood strangely mixed comes into conflict; 
meaning the habits under a belief system is challenged, to a better way of development. 
When the wise separates from the fool.

CHAPTER FOUR 
THE ART OF ANALYZATION 
God is in the details. 
Conduct an analysis: research that supplies information about the situation. This 
involves: 
A. Competitive Analysis: One must know who the [competition, individual, 
problem or issue] is and what they/it/are/is doing; how they are doing it, 
and why it was/is-being done. 
B. Competitive intelligence is the publicly available information on 
[competition, individual, problem or issue], current and potential; it has 3 
parts:  
C. 1). Defensive intelligence: Information gathered to avoid being caught off 
guard; serves to keep track of moves that deal with the issue, i.e., the legal 
ramifications.  
D. 2). Passive Intelligence: Information obtained for a specific decision. 
E. 3). Offensive Intelligence: Identifies new opportunities. Awareness of all  
current and potential opportunities and risks with the incident. An extensive 
understanding of the nature of the issue, both direct and indirect, to help 
obtain an advantage; complete a review of the person, issue, or incident, as 
well as the primary things in association with it. Familiarity with the 
strengths and weakness of the competition, person, or issue.

CHAPTER FIVE 
PSYCHOLOGY & THE ART OF THINKING 
Psychology: is the science of the mind (Soul) and behavior; the mental or behavioral 
characteristics12 of an individual or group. The study of the mind (Soul) and behavior 
in relation to a particular field of knowledge or activity. 
Thinking: is the actions of the Soul. Understanding and reasoning and willing are its 
actions also. Therefore, Thinking is a process of analyzing the data filtered through 4 
fundamental questions: Why, Who, How, and What, which in turn will give an 
understanding, so your reasoning capabilities has enough wisdom to strengthen your 
willing or choices . 
Thinking is your memories X’s what you are perceiving from your 5  main 
senses: processing through your Brain (Limbic System, etc.) to give you a probability 
of what you are perceiving or processing and what to do with that data, in the NOW or 
FUTURE. Or The Souls Behavioral Characteristics in motion for an activity. 
“Canst thou think to greatly of thy soul? Or can too much be said in its praise? It is the image 
of Him who gave it.” 
“Remember thou its dignity forever; forget not how great a talent is committed to thy charge.” 
“Whatsoever may do good, may also do harm. Beware that thou direct its course to virtue.” 
The end of her sech is truth; her means to discover it are reason and experience. But are not 
these weak, uncertain, and fallacious? How then shall she attain to it? General opinion is no 
proof of truth, for the generalities of men are ignorant. Perception of thyself, the knowledge of 
12 Characteristics are the attributes you developed in your youth. i.e., the 12 Step ladder.

Him who created thee, the sense of worship thou owest unto Him. Are not these plain before 
thy face? And behold! What is there more that man needed to know?13

CHAPTER 7 
RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD 
“The only Savior of the world is Love...” 
When the Right & Left hemisphere is balanced with the God principles you have what is known as a wise mind 
and enlighten being, a Master Mind, where the Holy Breath has made them One, again restoring harmony & 
peace. This state of peace does not happen overnight, although we do have the rest of our lives, every second 
that goes by is an opportunity to upgrade our Minds. The Animatic diagram below is a model of: 
The Spirit Man Attentive to the Soul-the Soul Firmly Grounded in Love-Actuating the Flesh. 
Love language to be memorized: 
Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom, 
I align my will with the Will of 
about this Day! Love flows 
from me, I am the Peace 
myself, I am, I achieve 
positive choices, I Love 
anything! I keep my 
needs in the bounds of 
I radiate happiness! I 
move forward with Hope, 
the 
answer 
to 
any 
I am successful in whatever 
myself!! 
and Justice. I am truthful 
within me, Truth flows 
within self, I know 
my Goals, I make 
myself! I can do 
desires, wants, and 
rightness! I am Free!  
Forgive myself- I 
Faith and Love, I have 
problems that may arise, 
I do!  I am amazing! I Love 
With this type of Knowledge of Self, it is easy to see the Love in others and make healthy choices while getting 
into relationships. The Love language is important for you to understand; [remember if you’re not 
programing your system {Mind] then someone or something else is.]. Should be attended to every morning 
12 
after prayer/meditation. Repeated Seven times, then at noon seven times, then before you go to bed seven 
times for 21 days. 
You have awoken the sleeping giant within, and have risen from a dead state of ignorance, to the 
knowledge of self and have come into the marvelous light, stay in the light of Love, and always fight the 
darkness of hate, especially self-hate. 
Even when it seems the darkest in your life you can now just turn on the Light!
