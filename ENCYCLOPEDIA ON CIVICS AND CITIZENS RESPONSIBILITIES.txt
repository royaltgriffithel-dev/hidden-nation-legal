Social Duties2 
 
Holy Instructions from The Founder Noble Drew Ali 
 
1. “When thou considereth thy wants, when thou beholdeth thy imperfections, 
acknowledge his goodness, O son of humanity, who honored thee with humanity, 
endowed thee with speech, and placed thee in society to receive and conger 
reciprocal helps and mutual obligations, protections from injuries, thy 
enjoyments of the comforts and pleasures of life; all these thou oweth to the 
assistance of others, and couldst, not enjoy but in the bans of society. 
2. It is thy duty, therefore, to be a friend to mankind, as it is thy interest that man 
should be friendly to thee. 
3. as the rose breatheth sweetness from its own nature so the heart of a benevolent 
man produceth good works. 
4. He enjoyeth the ease and tranquility of his own breast, and rejoiceth in the 
happiness and prosperity of his neighbor. 
5. He openeth not his ear unto slander; the faults and the failing of men give a pain 
to his heart. 
6. His desire is to do good, and he researceth out the occasions thereof; in removing 
the oppression of another, he relieveth himself. 
7. From the largeness of his mind, he comprehendeth in his wishes the happiness 
of all men; and from the generosity of his heart, he endeavoreth to promote it.”

The Social System 
BY: Honorable Marcus M. Garvey 
Society is an organization of mankind to safeguard and protect its own interest. 
When society is organized and is made evident by regulations, rules and laws, every 
member of that society must obey the said rules, regulations, and laws. Therefore, 
always live up to the organized system of society of which you form a part. The only 
alternative to this is rebellion. You should never join rebellious movements against 
society, except when there is good reason and justification for it. Society is intended 
to maintain the greatest good for the greatest number, and that is always uppermost 
so that in thought you may have to reform.  
Any society must be calculated to bring about the greatest good for the greatest 
number and you must obey its laws, otherwise you are an evil genius living among that 
society and that society will seek to destroy you or compel you to obey its rules, 
regulations, and laws. You cannot live by yourself in a society. You must live upon the 
good will of your fellows. Therefore, in that society you must respect everything that 
tends to the good of all. You should always seek to have something at stake in the 
community in which you live; property of some kind, to merit the regard and respect 
of the community. Society as it is organized into a community, counts first its 
worthwhile citizens before it thinks of others. Property in a community is evidence of 
your status in the society of the community.  
If you have no property, have something of substantial value. The police, the 
officials and the government recognize property holders as the citizens of first claim 
in an organized society. They are generally recorded to be identified. Therefore, you 
must teach the people to own property and to be known and recognized members of 
the community. Always adopt a friendly attitude towards the police in your community 
PAGE 2 
because the police are that civil body of officials who are supposed to protect the 
citizens and see that their rights are not infringed upon. You should always welcome 
the police. The police are never the public enemy, but the public protector. You should 
help the police to maintain order because if the community loses its peace, you will 
have riots and probably bloodshed. No peaceful citizen wants to be caught in such a 
dangerous state of public affairs. Never join in to incite public disorder. Keep away 
from it and be innocent to all that happens, by way of revolution. Never allow  your 
(DIVINE CREED’S) or your name to be mentioned as among RIOTERS, you will destroy 
the usefulness of the organization and yourself in that community and may cause 
suspicion to be cast upon it in other communities.  
Always disavow any attempt to label your divine creed, or yourself with riotous 
behavior. Whatever object is desired in a civilized community it can always be achieved 
by the approach of good reason and good judgment. Always use good reason and good 
judgment. You are not in a community to overthrow the law in that community. You are 
there to live under the law. The national aspiration of the race is to find expression, 
not in revolution where you are established when you are under other people’s 
government, but to accomplish the end in America. Therefore, never preach rebellion, 
because you will disrupt the society in which you live, and it will crush you.  
The highest service a citizen can refer to in a community or organized society is 
to maintain and preserve peace. When the peace is disturbed, it is likely that anybody 
may get hurt and sometimes most innocently. Never join the mob. You will most likely 
be shot or injured even though you may only be curious. If you are shot or injured in a 
riotous demonstration it is almost[always] evidence against you that you were one of 
the rioters. So, keep away. When the riot act or martial law is read or proclaimed in 
your community, keep indoors. Give this advice to the people. Never join a mob in a 
PAGE 3 
foreign country under a foreign government, or where you have very little political 
influence. 
CHAPTER 1 History: News Paper “Chicago Defender 1928” 
National Governments First National Convention Oct. 15-20th 1928 
Historical Article: “The Chicago Defender: July 14, 1928; “Moorish Leader Makes 
Plans for Conclave. Beginning Oct. 15 and continuing through the entire week the 
Moorish Science Temple America, of which Noble Drew Ali is founder and president, will 
hold its first general conference at Unity Hall, 3140 Indiana Ave Chicago Ill. President 
Ali began definite plans to this end upon his recent return from Pine Bluff, Ark., where 
he spent some days lecturing at the local Moorish Temple. This organization is playing 
a useful and definite part in advancing the sacred obligations of American citizenship. 
Indications are that this convention will be one of the most interesting ever held in this 
city. There will be delegates from 15 different states where local temples 
(municipalities)  have been established.  
There will be an interesting event in which men and women members will were 
regalia similar to that worn in eastern countries. A camel will be presented during the 
session, specific reports of the general work and civil accomplishment of local temples. 
Report of the business enterprises that have been established in connection with these 
temples, such as grocery and market stores in Detroit, a laundry in Pittsburgh, Pa. 
These examples of collective effort show that the member of the Moorish Temple and 
their leader have a sound economic program and are blazing a trail and making the 
pathway over which our prosperity may travel unhampered and unafraid. ‘It must be 
kept in mind that no great movement can take definite shape in two years so as to be 
err proof,’ said President Ali. ‘However, through accumulation experience each annual 
convention ought to witness a more perfect and wider functioning organization, 
PAGE 4 
representing the organized experience of men and women member throughout the 
country and possibly in time the world over’.  
And continuing, President Ali said ‘‘Constructive criticisms from sympathetic 
friends in and outside of our organization are welcome’ A Moorish parade and the 
announcement of the Moorish governing council also held interest. About this the 
article states: “It is reported that the prophet, the Supreme Executive Authority, will 
appoint a supreme grand council, of which he will be the grand chairman. The Supreme 
Council will have power and control and supervise all the affairs and properties of the 
Moorish Science Temple of America, and it will become sole judge of what constitutes 
conduct injurious to the order, peace and interest or welfare with its constitution and 
by-laws, also the rules and regulations made by the prophet, and shall be the sole judge 
of the sufficiency of the evidence by which such conduct is shown. Prophet Noble Drew 
Ali is being congratulated by Chicagoans of the success of the Moors’ first annual 
convention and for his splendid work in promoting the cause of human brotherhood 
The name Moorish Temple of Science was changed to The Moorish Science Temple of 
America.” 
 
STATE DOCUMENTS, QUOTES: 1ST CONVENTIONS MINUTE ORDERS: “In an article 
after the convention, we read that on the opening day that the two Grand Governors; T. 
Crumby Bey of Pittsburg and Lomax Bey of Detroit read reports, Alderman Louis B. 
Anderson gave an opening address and others such as Oscar DePriest (Congressman 
and member3), Attorney’s Aaron Payne (member), Richard Ross Bey (Sheik and 
member), States Attorney George W. Blackwell, and Claude D. Green (managing editor 
of the Moorish Guide and chairman of the convention arrangements committee) spoke. 
 
3 Oscar DE Priest (Bey)  Congressman was the first Asiatic (African American) voted back in Congress in 110 years in 1928 through the great work of our Founder Drew Ali and the Moorish 
Science Temple of America.

THE PROPHETS WARNING TO THE NATION FRIDAY, November 30, 1928  
Quotes: “The citizens of all free National Governments, according to their National 
Constitution, are all of one family bearing one free National name. Those who fail to 
recognize the free National name of their Constitutional Government are classed as 
undesirable and are subject to all inferior names and abuses and mistreatments that 
the citizen cares to bestow upon them. And it is a sin for any group of people to violate 
the National Government; and cling to the names and principles that delude to slavery. 
I, the Prophet, was prepared by the Great God Allah, to warn my people to repent from 
their sinful ways, and go back to that state of mind to their forefathers’ Divine and 
National Principles- that they will be law abiders and receive their divine right(s) as 
citizen(s) according to the free national Constitution that was prepared for all free 
National beings-they are to claim their own free National name and religion4.  
There is but one issue for them to be recognized by this Government and of the earth, 
and that comes only through the connection of the Moorish Divine National Movement 
and recognized by all other nations of the world. And through it they and their children 
can receive their divine rights, unmolested by other citizens. That they can cast a free 
National ballot to the polls under the free National Constitution of the United States 
Government, and not a “Granted Privilege” as has been the existing condition for many 
generations… 
Money does not make a man; it is free national standers and power that make a man 
and nation. The wealth of all National governments, gold d sliver commerce, belongs to 
the citizen alone; and without your national citizenship by name and principle, you have 
no true wealth. And I am herby calling on all true citizens that stand for a National Free 
Government and the enforcement of the Constitution to help me in my great missionary

work, because I need all support from all true American citizens of the United States 
of American to help me to save my people, who have fallen from the Constitutional laws 
of this government. I am depending on your support to get them back to hem 
Constitutional fold again, that they will learn to love, instead of hate, and will live 
according to Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom, and Justice, supporting our free National 
Constitution of the United States of America. 
I love my people, and I desire their unity and mine back to their own free national and 
Divine Standard, because day by day they have been violating the National and 
Constitutional Laws of their government by calming names and principles that are 
unconstitutional. If Italians, Greek, English, Chinese, Turks, and Arabians are forced to 
proclaim their free national name and religion before the Constitutional Government 
of the United States of America, it is no more than right that the law should be forced 
upon all American citizens alike. 
Through your free National name, you are known and recognized by all nations of the 
earth that are recognized by the said national government in which they live. The 14th 
In all other governments, when a man is born and raise there and asked his name of 
national decent and name if he fails to give it, he is misused, imprisoned, or exiled. Any 
group of people who fail to answer up to the Constitutional Standards of Law by name 
and principle, because to be a citizen of any government you must claim your National 
name descent. Because they place their trust upon issue and names that they are not 
a part and partial of, and nether were they formed by their forefathers. The word 
‘Negro” deludes in Latin language to the word “nigger”; the same, the word “colored” 
deludes to anything that is painted, varnished, and dyed, and every nation must bear a 
national descent name of their forefathers, because honoring thy father and thy 
mothers, your days will be lengthened upon this earth. These names have never been 
recognized by any true American citizens of this day.   
PAGE 6 
and 15th amendments brought the North and South in unity; placing the Southerner, 
which was at that time without power, with the Constitutional Body of power. And at 
that time, 1865, the free national Conational Law that was enforced since 1774 declared 
by the Free National Constitution to be free and equal, since that Constitution has never 
been changed, there is no need for the application of the 14th and 15th Amendments for 
the Salvation of our people and citizens. 
So, there isn’t but one supreme issue for my people to use to redeem that which 
was lost, and that is through the above statements, then the lion and the lamb can lie 
down to gather in yonder hills and neither will be harmed; because Love, Truth, Peace, 
Freedom, and Justice will be reigning in this land. In those days the United Stated will 
be one of the greatest civilized and prosperous government of the world, but if the 
above principles are not carried out by the citizen and my people in this government, 
the worst is yet to come, because the Great God of the Universe is not pleased with the 
work that are being performed in North America by my people, and this great sin must 
be removed from the land to save it from enormous earthquakes, diseases, etc. 
This is a field held open men to strong men and women to uplift the nation and 
take your place in the affairs of men. If the European and other nations are helping me, 
The Voice of the Founder of the National Government 
If you have race pride and love your race, join the Moorish Science Temple of 
America, and become a part of this Divine Movement. Then you will have power to 
redeem your race because you will know who you are, and your forefathers were. 
Because where there is unity, there is strength. : “Together we stand, divided we fall.” 
Come, good people, because I, the Prophet, was sent to redeem this nation from mental 
slavery, which you have now, need every one of you who think(s) your condition can be 
better.  
PAGE 7 
why not you? It is your problem. The Negro and,(Latino) problem is being solved only 
as it can, and that is by the Moorish Divine Movement. If you have a nation, you must 
have a free national name in order to be recognized by this nation as an American 
citizen. This is what was meant when it was said “Seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven 
and all these things would be added unto you.” By the Prophet 
Thus, the United States of America became a true nation under God when the prophet 
wrapped the Moorish Flag around the little Moorish girl and the American Flag around 
Another important historical distinction needs to be made: The help the 
Prophet gave to the United States was legitimacy. Before the Prophet Drew Ali’s great 
work, the United States was not considered to be a nation in the sense of international 
law and was ruled on by the Supreme Court in 1794 in the case of Chrisholm v. Georgia, 
2 Dall. (U.S.) 419, 1 L. Ed. 440 (1793). United States the country is a ‘society’ and 
‘sovereignty’ but not a “nation” under the laws of nations by the supreme court’s own 
admission. when it said: This is a case of uncommon magnitude. One of the parties to 
it is a State; certainly respectable, claiming to be sovereign. The question to be 
determined is, whether this State, so respectable, and whose claim soars so high, is 
amenable to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States? This question, 
important in itself, will depend on others, more important still; and may, perhaps, be 
ultimately resolved into one, no less radical than this 'do the people of the United States 
form a Nation?' A cause so conspicuous and interesting should be carefully and 
accurately viewed from every possible point of sight. I shall examine it, 1st. By the 
principles of general jurisprudence. 2nd. by the laws and practice of States and 
Kingdoms. From the law of nations little or no illustration of this subject can be 
expected. By that law the several States and Governments spread over our globe, are 
considered as forming a society, not a NATION. [Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. (U.S.) 419, 
1 L.Ed. 440 (1793)]

the little Moorish boy at the 1st National Convention of 1928. “…I made you a nation within 
a nation the wheel within the wheel…” Prophet Drew Ali. Thus, the Moorish Science

Government or National Republic of the United State of America.  
HIGH STANDARDS. 
— Civilization is not a circle but a pyramid. At its base is found the constantly 
increasing mass of humanity. Out of this common material the world has been busily 
engaged in building the structure of civilization. No one is compelled to remain at the 
base of the pyramid who has within himself the ability to find his way up. From that 
base have come most of the great men in history. Few born in riches or high social 
position have ever achieved greatness. By her system of Government America is at the 
mercy of those at the base of the pyramid. If through individual initiative and proper 
leadership they win their way toward the apex, they lift America also. If they remain 
inert, ignorant, indifferent, they become the common prey of unscrupulous leaders who 
seek to weaken or destroy the structure of our government. 
Without knowledge of self-government, denied the opportunity for self-development, 
eagerly responding to the call of American opportunity, emigrated to our shores, here 
CITIZENSHIP TRAINING. 
— Training in citizenship is the most vital of all subjects to that nation whose system 
of government, security of property, and full power to express individual initiative are 
based upon the intelligence, education, and character of each individual citizen. 
PAGE 9 
PAGE 10 
to enjoy full participation in the rights of American citizenship without a proper 
Understanding of the meaning of liberty or the nature and value of our free institutions, 
the very foundation of which is laid in intelligent and active participation in government 
by our individual citizens. A course of instruction in citizenship to be effective must 
develop the social phase of citizenship and be particularly directed to the native and 
foreign-born youth, setting up a clear understanding of this great problem of 
assimilation and amalgamation of the bloods of all nations into the virile life stream of 
America. 
GENERAL PURPOSE. — This course in citizenship is designed to teach the fundamental 
principles upon which our Government is founded, including an insight into the social 
and economic elements upon which our civilization stands. Special emphasis is laid 
upon the meaning of "Religious liberty," as interpreted by the founders of this Republic, 
and the larger relationship of the individual citizen to others and to his Government, 
defining loyalty and national responsibility in terms of citizenship, recognizing that an 
intelligent and informed people is a greater asset than are the unintelligent, 
uninformed, or misinformed, and that no government can exist upon a plane higher 
than the moral character of its people.  
Knowledge, the safeguard of our Republic. — Because of the rapid increase in 
our population, largely made up of immigrants from all parts of the world, the tendency 
within the family and the school is to neglect the training of our youth in the knowledge 
of his government and his individual responsibility. It cannot be expected that foreign
born parents, lacking knowledge or inspiration of American ideals, will be either fitted 
or inspired to give such instruction to their own children. 
The indifference or the neglect of native-born citizens concerning the training of 
their children to meet the responsibilities of citizenship is largely caused by lack of 
PAGE 11 
information and proper tinder standing of the history, ideals, and underlying principles 
of our political institutions. 
The solution of the problems of citizenship lies largely in the education of the 
youth of America in the principles of representative government and their personal 
responsibility in perpetuating and improving her free institutions.  
CHARACTER BUILDING. — The ever-increasing wants as compared to the needs of 
humanity, the added individual burdens, and problems of modern civilization, 
emphasizing material rather than ethical and spiritual attainment, are tending to break 
down the character of our youth. 
It is the mission of this course to especially emphasize the moral aspects of citizenship 
— to build up home discipline, reverence for religion, and respect for constituted 
authority.  
 NATIONAL DEFENSE. — Education and training in citizenship form a vital part of national 
defense. It will be the mission of this course to interpret national defense through a 
broad and comprehensive instruction in citizenship, stressing the responsibility of the 
individual citizen to become fully prepared for the defense of his country in any 
emergency that may arise, whether of domestic or foreign import, in peace or in war. 
Under the immigration act the following classes of persons are excluded from entering 
the United States: 
a. Idiots. 
b. Insane. 
c. Epileptics. 
d. Paupers and persons likely to become a public charge. 
e. Professional beggars. 
PAGE 12 
f. Rapist & Pedophiles  
Persons suffering from tuberculosis or other dangerous or loathsome contagious 
diseases. Persons physically or mentally so defective as to be unable to making a 
living. But not limited to.  
 
Right of suffrage. — Under the Constitution, the National Government confers 
American citizenship, but it is left to the States to determine who may vote at both its 
own and national elections.  
Under the Constitution, voting is the only means provided for the expression of public 
opinion — it is the exercise of the will of the citizen in the protection of his rights. 
 OBLIGATIONS OF NATIONAL CITIZENSHIP. — Active national citizenship is gained only by 
becoming an enfranchised citizen of the National Government. This carries with it the 
obligation of a clear understanding of the principles of government and the courage to 
demand that these principles be not abridged. 
It is essential that the individual citizen — Exercise his right of franchise — vote — as 
his paramount duty at all elections. Uphold the Constitution as the one assurance of 
the security and perpetuation of the free institutions of America. Practice self
government to assure good government for all.  
Respect the rights of others, to assure the enjoyment of his own. Contribute to 
the maintenance of his government by the payment of taxes. Obeying the law as the 
first essential to law enforcement. Place service to country above service to self. 
Conform his conduct to the best interests of society.  
The opportunities and privileges of the American citizen are limited only by his 
individual ability, his personal habits, and conformity to necessary legal regulations. It 
PAGE 13 
is your obligation to exercise — Care in your choice of occupation. Diligence in 
preparation for your task. Thrift to insure advancement and prosperity. Judgment in 
selection of companions. Integrity, honor, initiative, self-reliance, self-control. 
Be, Beneficial to production. — Industry is essentially the subjection of natural 
forces — the manipulation of natural material to the uses of mankind; it brings into 
action the worker, the engineer, the inventor, the organizer, the administrator, the 
combined energies of whom are liberated and set in motion by finance.  
Accumulation of capital. — Thrift is the foundation stone of effective economic 
interdependence. The individual must practice frugality, engage in hard work, and 
acquire the habit of wise spending — so living within his means as to enable a saving 
of a portion of the product of his labor. In industry wealth is the product of saving; it is 
secured in part by the elimination of waste and the corresponding conservation of 
materials and labor practiced by both individuals and groups, and saving or the 
accumulation of capital is as much the duty of the employee as of the employer.  
Relations between management and men. — To derive the greatest value from 
the interdependent relationship between employer and employee there must be 
created a spirit of good will and cooperation in which there is a recognition of mutual 
worth and mutual responsibility. The atmosphere surrounding the relationship between 
management and men must eliminate fear, apprehension, and uncertainty. 
 Only by the establishment of mutual understanding, confidence, and respect can 
effective cooperation and teamwork be secured. That employee renders best service 
who has an intelligent understanding of the relation of his part to the whole. 
WE ARE A NATION OF SPECIALISTS. — We are a Nation of specialists because 
experience has taught us that greater benefits will accrue to one and all through each 
individual learning to do one thing well. The physician looks after our health. The 
PAGE 14 
teacher gives instruction. The farmer grows the grain. The lawyer attends to legal 
matters. Others specialize in providing all the comforts and conveniences of home. No 
one citizen builds his own house, manufactures the plumbing equipment, generates the 
electricity, constructs the heating plant, or provides the fuel for its operation. He does 
not pave the street, put in his own waterworks, provide police, and fire protection, 
establish his own school, church, hospital, or theater. 
Be Beneficial to peace. — In America a degree of independence is developed 
out of which is born the idea in the minds of many that a citizen of the United States 
may be a law unto himself, retaining, however, the disposition to regulate the other 
fellow. If he does not like the law he seeks a way to evade it, at the same time shouting 
vociferously over the increase of crime and the lessened influence of our courts.  
He demands the highest wages obtainable and complains at the prices he must 
pay for the product of his fellow laborer. He insists upon his right to independence and 
liberty, yet is ever ready to restrict such action on the part of others. That citizen who 
has not developed the spirit of cooperation, understanding and tolerance is at war with 
his fellow man. 
Unselfishness. — Every American citizen must guard against the spirit of 
selfishness, the inordinate desire for material gain, the temptation to live beyond his 
means, and the tendency to find the easiest way to obtain the most in satisfying his 
constantly increasing wants. 
Honesty — individual and collective, national, and international — inspiring 
confidence wherein there is neither room for trickery nor unfair practices is the basis 
of the principle of interdependent relationships. Such honesty rests not so much upon 
legal rights as upon the Golden Rule. 
Class consciousness. — Class consciousness and class activity is the result 
largely of the intrusion of ideas of government entirely outside of the fixed principles 
set forth in our Constitution and should be no more tolerated in our country than we 
would expect our principles, if introduced by expatriated Americans, to be accepted by 
another nation. Classism is the foundations of racism and is not tolerated in our 
civilized society. 
Immigrant is not the problem. — The immigrant is not the problem. He has 
been one of the outstanding assets in the development of America. Slowly, but surely, 
there is being assimilated and amalgamated in this country the bloods of practically all 
nations, in the development of a racial stock of exceptional worth in 'its vigor, ability, 
and character. Our opportunity. — One of our greatest problems is the education, 
assimilation, and amalgamation of these various and numerous foreign groups into an 
understanding, harmonious, loyal, and upstanding American citizenship.  
Why is Nationality the order of the day? Has anyone ever answered or asked that 
question to their government official or better yet yourself? Good. The Holy Prophet 
To this and succeeding generations is given the opportunity to develop from our 
homogeneous character an outstanding race expressive of the highest principles, 
ideals, and traditions to which a God-loving, humanity-loving, liberty-loving people can 
aspire. 
To accomplish this great work there must be a composition of all differences 
which tend to create class consciousness and class hatreds. Tolerance, born of 
knowledge, understanding, respect, sympathy, and harmony, engendered by the spirit 
of a common cause and purpose.

Noble Drew Ali and his divine Ministers of his cabinet gave out calling cards to the 
Asiatic of North America, which told us to… “Come all ye Asiatic and learn the Truth 
about your Nationality and Birthrights, because you are not colored, etc. (Black, Latino). 
And you must claim a free national name to be an American citizen…” Did you get your 
divine calling? 
CIVIC’S OF NATIONALITY [BLK’sLaw6th] Nationality: “that quality or character which 
arise from the fact of a person belonging to a nation or state. Nationality determines 
the political status especially with reference to allegiance, while domicile determines 
his civil status. Nationality arises ether by birth or naturalization.” Nationality affords 
the state jurisdiction over the person and affords the person the protection of the 
state.  
The two most important parts of this definition to understand from a scientific 
eye is domicile and thee most important from these two are political status. Some facts 
about Nationality: 1.1 is a political status, 1.2 is defined by the Constitution, which is a 
political document. 1.3 Is synonymous with being a ‘national’ within statutory law. 1.4. 
Gives one the right to political association. 1.5 Gives one constitutional citizenship. 1.6 
Is associated with a specific country. 1.7 Is called a ‘political citizen’ or a citizen of the 
United States in a political sense, by the courts to distinguish it from a STATUTORY 
citizen. See Powel v United States, 109 F.2d 147 (1940), Nationality therefore is the 
principal relationship that connects an individual to a state. Let us Look at Political 
Status and begin to connect the dots. 
[BLK 6th p.1158] Political: pertaining or relating to the policy or the administration 
of government, state or national. Pertaining to or incidental to, the exercise of the 
functions vested in those charged with the conduct of government; of or pertaining to 
exercise of rights and privileges or the influence by which individuals of a state seek 
to determine or control its public policy; having to do with organization or action of 
PAGE 17 
individual parties. Political status gives one Political Rights. Political Rights are those, 
which may be exercised in the formation or administration of the government. Rights 
of a citizen established or recognized by constitution (Divine Constitution & By-Laws) 
which gives them the power to participate directly or indirectly in the establishment 
or administration of government.  
Nationality gives one Political Right’s within those political rights is the right of 
association to associate with your political community: the right to freedom of 
association and freedom from compelled association, (first Amendment to the 
Constitution). Association is the freedom to choose; choose a domicile,(“…let the bonds 
of affection, therefore unite thee with thy brothers, that peace and happiness may 
dwell in thy father’s house and when ye separate in the world, remember the relation 
that bindeth you to love and unity; and prefer not a stranger before thy own blood.” 
HKofMSTofA XXV: 2-3) it is voluntarily entered.  
 
Please at this stage pay very close attention….When you choose your 
associations (political community) which is determined by your ‘Domicile’ you have 
chosen your Civil Status or Legal status. At this stage if one has proclaimed his 
nationality with the lawful government aka The Moorish Science Temple of America; 
Home Office of Noble Drew Ali, 805 7th St. Eureka Ca 95501., and its lawful branch 
temples (Act 1. Additional Laws) and “…proclaimed their (your) free national name in 
the government in which you live and the nations of the earth…” you are a ‘National’… 
(We the People) well that is yet to be determined. Let us define a few more terms before 
we move on. Domicile: a person’s legal home. That place where a man has his true 
fixed, and permanent home and principal establishment, and to which whenever he is 
absent has the intention of returning. Smith v. Smith 206 Pa.Super.310, 213 A.2d 94. 
Generally. Physical presence within a state and the intention to make it one’s home are 
PAGE 18 
the requirements of establishing a ‘domicile’ therein. A person may have more than 
one residence but only one domicile.  
The legal domicile of a person is important since it rather than the actual resident 
often controls the jurisdiction of the taxing and policing authorities(i.e., tickets, 
infraction of the law) and determines where a person may exercise the 
privileges/rights of voting and other legal rights and immunities. (Speaking on taxes 
for all you who are reluctant about taxes ...Being domicile and not nationality is what 
imputes a status under the tax code and a liability for tax.) 
TAX LIABILITY 
Tax liability is civil liability that attaches to civil statutory law, which attaches to 
a ‘person’ through their choice of domicile. {Your Per-Capita Tax to your domicile is 
very important. To be able to prove you pay taxes to your lawful Civil government were 
your domiciled at,} (Ask yourself -can they tax a Religious Body Politic. What about an 
agent [missionary or citizen] from that Body politic? [See 1099 form; ‘Our Authority’]) 
No one can force you to acquire or retain a domicile anywhere, including within the 
federal government or to accept the civil status that attaches to it of statutory citizen 
(14th Amendment citizen) or resident. It is voluntary. Domicile determines your Civil 
and Legal and Statutory status. It does not determine your political status or 
Nationality. Civil Status or Legal status: (Civil: originally pertaining to or appropriate 
to a member of a civitas or free political community; natural or proper to a citizen 
{National}.  
The taxing clause. — The taxing clause permits taxes to be levied for the 
requirements of government only; such taxes to be uniform in application and subject 
to revision as necessity governs. 
PAGE 19 
The Congress shall have power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts' and 
Excises, to pay the debts and provide for the Common Defense and Welfare of the 
United States. * * * To declare War, grant letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make 
rules concerning captures on Land and Water; to raise and support Armies, but no 
appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years. * * * To 
provide and maintain a Navy; To make rules for the Government and Regulation of the 
land and naval forces; To provide for calling forth the Militia; to execute the laws of the 
Union, to suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions; To provide for organizing, arming 
and disciplining the Militia. * * * — Constitution, Article I, section 8. 
NATIONALITY AND CIVIL STATUS-CONTINUED  
Also, relating to the community, or to the policy and government of the citizen 
and subject of a state.) Civil Status: gives you 1. The ability to contract with other 
parties including the government. 2. Politically and legally associate with groups you 
choose to associate with. *3. Choose or nominate the civil government that you want 
to protect your rights to life liberty and property...this is where your jury of peers is 
established, etc.3.1 choosing a domicile is an act of political association that has legal 
consequences in which you nominate a specific municipal government to protect your 
rights and property.[In others word the local governmental laws that will govern you]  
This is why the Declaration of Independence says that all just powers of 
government are derived from the consent of the people. Those who do not concede to 
a civil municipality have no civil protection or real Civil Rights you would be 
automatically presumed to have a statutory citizenship status [14th Amendment citizen 
see Civiliter Mortuus or Civil Death]. Domicile is how you exercise rights 2 and 3. You 
can choose where your domicile is, and you can change it at any time. When you choose 
PAGE 20 
a domicile, you elect or nominate a protector, which in turn gives rise to an obligation 
to pay for the civil protection demanded (Taxes). 
 The method of providing that protection is the civil laws of the municipal (as in 
Branch Temple) jurisdiction that you chose a domicile within; ( Divine Constitution and 
By-Laws, Additional Laws, the Koran, General Laws, Supreme Laws, Rules, and 
Regulations, of the Prophet are the civil laws of the religious government (National 
Government) Now what does it all mean? Well, when one proclaims a Nationality their 
Political Status {political rights} is established (‘National’ of the United States of 
America, Moorish American) giving you the choice to associate with a political 
community(Grand Temple, Grand Major Temples, Branch Temples) to establish your 
Civil Status/Legal Status your laws that will govern you. By your choice of 
Domicile ;( Home Office of Noble Drew Ali) thus creating the political or constitutional 
and civil status of a human being. A National a true American citizen of the United 
States of America the Republic. A Moorish American! We The People,  
Let us go a little further. nationality affords you your citizenship as a national, a 
constitutional citizen. citizens are members of a political community who in their 
associated capacity, have established or submitted themselves to the dominion of a 
government. {the religious Body Politic aka Moorish Science Temple of 
America/National Government.} By giving up some of their natural rights for the 
promotion of their general welfare and the protection of their individual as well as 
collective rights. Herriot v City of Seattle 81 Wash. 2d 48 500 P 2nd 101, 109.  
Citizen one who under the Constitution and laws of the United States of America 
or of a particular state, is a member of the political community owing allegiance 
(allegiance is associated with Nationality allegiance is what makes one a 
citizen/subject of a country.) And being entitled to the enjoyments of full Civil Rights. 
PAGE 21 
One’s full Civil Rights are enforced through municipal civil law, which in turn can only 
attach to one’s choice of legal domicile. 
CHAPTER III NATIONAL CITIZENSHIP AND/OR NATIONAL OF THE U.S.A. 
  Defined under federal law pursuant to 8U.S.C Sec. 1101(a)(12), under laws of Nation, 
under state Laws and under U.S.A. Constitution. (I). Is equivalent to the term “state 
citizen” (II). In general, born in any one of the several states of the union but not in a 
federal territory, possession, or the Districts of Columbia, and not domiciled in the 
federal zone.( III). Owes allegiance to ‘We the People’, collective, and individually within 
the body politic of the constitutional state residing in. (Moorish Science Temple of 
America)  May serve as a state jurist or grand jurist involving only parties with his/her 
same citizenship and domicile status. ( Jury of your peers).  
May vote in state elections (electors)  Is a man or woman whose unalienable 
natural rights are recognized, secured, and protected by his state (Body Politic) 
National citizenship is a Constitutional citizen: Constitutional Citizen is a political status 
tied to: (I). Nationality (II). The U.S. Constitution (III). Political jurisdiction and a specific 
political status “Nation” under the laws of Nations.  
See National or state national or national of the United State of America or United 
States under 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101 (a) (21) National can also be described as a “citizen” 
when he/she is domiciled within the territorial and legislative jurisdiction of the 
Political Body to which one claims allegiance, being a ‘National” is therefore an 
attribute and a prerequisite of being a citizen and the term can be used to describe 
‘citizen.” “Any group of people who fail to answer up to the Constitutional Standards of 
Law by name and principle, (Surname and Law) because to be a citizen of any 
government you must claim your national name and descent.”

family then forming part of his household. 
(7) “National of the United States” has the meaning prescribed in section 
101(a)(22) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(22)). (c) If the victim 
of an offense under subsection (a) is an internationally protected person outside the

offender is a national of the United States, or (3) an offender is afterwards found in 
the United States. As used in this subsection, the United States includes all areas under 
the jurisdiction of the United States including any of the places within the provisions of 
PAGE 23 
sections 5 and 7 of this title and section 46501(2) of title 49. (d) In the course of 
enforcement of this section and any other sections prohibiting a conspiracy or attempt 
to violate this section, the Attorney General may request assistance from any Federal, 
State, or local agency, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force, any statute, rule, or 
regulation to the contrary notwithstanding. Section 101(a)(22) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act (INA) states that “the term ‘national of the United States’ means (A) a 
citizen of the United States, or (B) a person who, though not a citizen of the United 
States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States.” Therefore, U.S. citizens are 
also U.S. nationals. 
CHAPTER IV NATIONAL GOVERNMENT’S RELIGIOUS STRUCTURE 
The entire structure of the National Republic of the United States of America 
Religious structure and its citizens, its laws, customs, duties, Rules, Regulations, are 
all under a Religious Body Politic a Nation. (Only comparison would be the Vatican 
Religious Governmental organization)  RE: Our Authority “Corporation-Religious 
Affidavit of Organization”. Religious Corporation Act Ch. 32 par.164 Sec.35 “Any church, 
congregation or society formed for the purpose of religious worship may become 
incorporated in the following… and may adopt a corporate, by name… it shall and 
remain a body politic and corporate, by the name so adopted. What do other laws say 
about Religion? RFRA (Religious freedom and restoration Act)  
Respect for religion. — The "National Government" believes in the exercise of 
religious freedom and shows tolerance toward and respect for all religious beliefs. 
The American Government rests upon the deep religious convictions of her 
people. If it is to continue it will be through unceasing respect for and confidence in 
the nobler things of life. 
PAGE 24 
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. — No greater liberty was ever conferred on a people than that 
of freedom to worship according to the dictates of one's own conscience. The first 
amendment to the Constitution declares that "Congress shall make no law respecting 
an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof." 
All persons have the privilege to entertain any religious belief, practice any 
religious rite, teach any religious doctrine, which is not subversive of morality and 
does not interfere with the personal rights of others. However, this liberty cannot be 
"invoked as a protection against legislation for the punishment of acts inimical to the 
peace, good order, and morals of society," because professed doctrines of religious 
belief are not superior to the laws of the land. No person is permitted to become a law 
unto himself, nor may they in the name of religion, or through a religious ceremony, 
violate the law.  
Religious liberty does not include the right to introduce and carry out every 
scheme or purpose which people see fit to claim as a part of their religious system. 
While there is no legal authority to constrain belief, no one can lawfully stretch his own 
liberty of action so as to interfere with that of his neighbors or violate peace or good 
order. — United States Supreme Court. Laws are made for the government of actions, 
and while they cannot interfere with mere religious beliefs and opinions, they may with 
practices. — United States Supreme Court. 
Religion laid the foundations of our American Government. It neither seeks nor 
claims any justification for its existence save righteousness. It had its beginning. it 
found its inspiration, in the religious beliefs of the men who settled our country, made 
it an independent Nation, and maintained its institutions and laws. If it is to endure it 
will be through the support of men of like mind and like character. — President Coolidge. 
PAGE 25 
POLITICAL RIGHTS. — It protects the citizen in his personal freedom. Equal political rights 
are assured. He has a voice in the Government which is "of the people, for the people, 
and by the people." When a people are free to undertake things and take advantage of 
the opportunities open to them wealth, character, and national strength are developed. 
Political right are established by ones nationality.  Protection to home and family. — 
The social unit of civilization is the family. Under this form of government, the 
institution of marriage and the rights of childhood are respected, the home and the 
family are protected, and womanhood is inviolable.  
 The supreme Court had found “exercise” to be burdened when laws interfere with 
a particular religious practice or ceremony (Gonzales v O Centro espirita Beneficento 
Uniao do Vegetal, 564. U.S. 418 (2000) “Courts may not decide matters of church 
doctrine or governance.”(Cf. Kedroff v St. Nicholas Cathedral, 344 U.S. 94,116 (1952)) 
U.S. v Ballard (1944) The Courts found that neither neither the courts nor the 
government have the right to evaluate the religious beliefs of a citizen or group. 
*Waston v Jones, 80 U.S. (13 Wall) Courts may not interfere in matters of church 
doctrine, discipline, or policy. [T]he First Amendment rest upon the premise that both 
religion and government can best work to achieve their lofty aims if each is left free 
from the other within it-respected sphere. (Jurisdiction) Justice Hugo Black (Mc 
Collum v Board of Education, 333 U.S. 203, 212 (1984))  
According to the United States Supreme Acts of State to wit: “Every sovereign 
state is bound to respect the independence of every other sovereign State and the 
courts of another country will NOT SIT in Judgment on the acts of the government of 
another, done within its own territory.” Also, where rights are secured by the 
Constitution are involved, there can be no rulemaking or legislation which would 
abrogate them Miranda v Arizona 384 US 436,125: (10) PAGE 135 The claim and exercise

Moorish Science Temple of America deriving its power and authority for the Grate

Great Prophet of Ali in America.”

the importance of ‘KEEPING THE PROPHET OUT IN FRONT’ the jurisprudence thereof

CHAPTER V    Character  
The greatest asset of America. — Diversity of opinion as to what is America's greatest 
asset creates a discussion which leads into every section and every activity of our 
country. Everyone is governed by the interest that lies closest to his heart. 47. 
Character. — What unites a people composed of all the racial stocks of the world? What 
composes our differences, harmonizes our relationships? What inspires confidence, 
ensures credit, and promotes organization?  
What, in the last analysis, guarantees protection of person and property, gives 
assurance of peace and prosperity, and inspires America to greater adventures and 
larger achievements? The answer is not to be found in the sum of all her natural 
 
5 Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America Ch. XLIII: 18 
PAGE 28 
resources, factories, farms, homes, schools, hospitals, and churches. These are 
created by man and by man can be destroyed. The security of our property, the 
continuation of our institutions, the increase of our possessions and the perpetuity of 
the principles of individual rights, justice, and freedom, the observance of which has 
made America, lie in character — the greatest asset of America. 
Foundation of character. — The character of the individual and the Nation is 
founded upon religion and education — which, united with that force we call "will," give 
to every individual the means for high attainment. Submitting yourself to these 
impelling influences, resourcefulness and unconquerable energy take command. By 
their power you win self-mastery. The joy of work becomes a reality. Labor is dignified 
by the pride of accomplishment. Obstacles and handicaps are but a challenge to 
greater effort. Discipline becomes self-imposed. 
Daily performance necessary. — Expressed in terms of unselfish devotion to 
ideals, our attitude to others, our sense of responsibility, our willingness to give full 
service, loyal cooperation, our faithfulness to each other, and our reverence for 
religion, embodied in the daily performance of every task, "character" is the greatest 
asset of America. 
Spirit of improvement and invention. — Ever willing to adopt new ideas, to 
develop and improve, to tear down and rebuild, to scrap the machine of yesterday for 
the improved equipment of to-day, opportunity was never neglected to find a better 
way to do a larger business. 
Success possible to every citizen. — Driven first by necessity, the joy of 
accomplishment became the spur to greater achievements. The way to comfort, to 
competency, to wealth was open and free to every citizen, limited alone by individual 
ability, courage, and determination. Out of great opportunity, with freedom to all, there 
PAGE 29 
has been bred a race of men and women of sterling character and outstanding 
independence. 
Ethical character. — Confidence. — American business is based upon the 
character of its people. 
Spirit of cooperation and compromise. — One of the most encouraging signs 
of continued prosperity in America is the constantly growing tendency toward 
compromise and cooperation in the affairs of capital and labor, based upon mutual 
confidence. Such differences as are bound to arise are, as a rule, disposed of to the 
general good of all. 
No class domination. — No class is permitted to dominate in America. Public 
opinion, which is always representative of public character, will not permit the 
assumption of power. Whether it be capital, labor, farmer, group, or section, public 
character in its dominant sense of fair dealing defeats the effort to acquire unfair 
advantage. 
Spirit of benevolence. — Nothing is more characteristic of modern American 
life than the pouring out of private wealth for public service. 
Political character. — Diplomacy. — America is slowly ret surely winning the 
confidence of the nations of the world. The desire to arbitrate rather than resort to 
armaments has distinguished America in her international policy, desiring to adjust all 
differences within the principles of justice and equity. Her commercial treaties are 
written in terms of square dealing. Backed by the guaranty of the American character, 
her obligations and her dollars are eagerly accepted wherever they may be offered. 
Community life, religious meetings, and town meeting. —  
PAGE 30 
Possessing pride of race, proud of their ancestry, they inspired in the hearts of 
their children a reverence and respect for family and race which left no room for lax 
conduct or easy habits. Severely disciplined within their homes, carefully supervised 
in their education, the children were taught the obligation of participation in community 
affairs and were obliged to submit to the severe restrictions imposed by their elders 
through the laws enacted by the local town meeting. 
VOTING: A NATIONAL REQUIREMENT 
 Moorish Guide New Paper: Political Slavery Friday, February 19, 1929 
 “Anytime a Man or Woman fails or refuse to cast a sacred ballot at the polls they 
separate themselves from all rights of an American citizen. For surly this is the one 
connecting medium for a citizen to his nation. They become no more than belated beast 
of burdens. There are reasons why certain classes, who are more or less independent, 
take no part in politics since they say they get nothing out of such in the way of material 
gain. This is no less than a political slave since they refuse to voice their sentiments at 
the poll. Another form of political slavery which is probably more prevalent among the 
less independent classes is that of being forced into one of the major parties and there 
bribed, coerced, or otherwise forced to vote the wishes of someone else regardless 
of their own minds. Before there can be general relief for the economic good of all, all 
forms of political slavery must be abolished, and every citizen must take his part in the 
affairs of the nation.”  
 
CHAPTER VI LIBERTY AND INDEPENDENCE 
 
PAGE 31 
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, A PROTEST. — The Declaration of Independence was a 
protest against the abridgment of such rights as the colonists claimed as subjects of 
the British Crown. Their anger was directed against Parliament rather than the King 
because restrictions were placed by law upon the colonists which were not imposed 
upon citizens of Great Britain residing in the mother country.  
These operated solely for the benefit of the long-established home government 
and institutions. Spurred by the spirit of independence engendered through the bitter 
experiences and necessary self-reliance required in their century-and-a-half battle to 
conquer the American wilderness, and fired by the indignities and injustice to which 
they had long been compelled to submit, they threw off the yoke of oppression and set 
up a government that would forever guard them against tyranny, however it might seek 
to impose its will.  
“When in the Course of human events. it becomes necessary for one people to 
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume 
among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of 
Nature and of Nature's God entitled them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind 
requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation — We 
hold these truths to be self-evident. that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, 
Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. And for the support of this Declaration, with a 
firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other 
our Lives. our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.” — Declaration of Independence. 
“ No man sought or wished for more than to defend his own. None hoped to 
plunder or spoil * * * and we all know that it could not have lived a single day under 
any well-founded imputation of passion.” — Webster. 
PAGE 32 
Its enemies. — The "enemies within" who would make the Declaration of Independence 
a mockery play one group of Americans against another. They fan the flames of 
prejudice. They magnify fancied evils of injustices to the ignorant. They distort its 
language to suit their own ends so cleverly that many of the less informed follow them 
in the name of Americanism. 
Its survival. — Every American citizen must be constantly on guard if the principles 
set forth in the Declaration of Independence are to survive. 
LIBERTY DEFINED. — There are two kinds of liberty — absolute liberty: That of the 
democracy, in which any individual may act as he pleases by mob rule; and civil liberty: 
That of a civilized community in which human actions are regulated by law for the good 
of all — subject only to such restraints as a solemn and tolerant judgment determines 
to be essential. 
Political liberty is no other than natural liberty so far restrained by human laws 
and no further, as is necessary and expedient for the general advantage of the public. 
— Blackstone. 
Liberty does not free the people from the necessity for control, but it places a 
heavy burden of responsibility upon the individual for self-control. It is not a license to 
do as one pleases. Through developed “intelligence" man has power to control his 
baser and more selfish instincts, compelling their exercise and restriction in the 
interest of society.  
Minority control exercises its will until such time as general intelligence becomes 
sufficiently informed to establish an order of society with a larger and more even 
distribution of benefit to all, and the law of will (force) is supplanted by the law of 
reason. As defined in the Preamble to the American Constitution, liberty is the absence 
PAGE 33 
of arbitrary human restraints upon personal conduct other than those imposed by the 
authority of just laws, obedience to which is an essential part of it. 
Fundamental law. — The rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit happiness are beyond 
the right of any government to legally usurp of or infringe. 
To secure this (liberty) is the main business of governments and the reason for their 
institution. If they fall in this, they have failed in all. — Blackstone. 
These principles were written by our fathers into a constitution of government, for the 
first time in human history, when they wrote the Constitution and it became the 
fundamental law of a new nation dedicated to the proposition that "all men are created 
equal" and that "government derives its just powers from the consent of the 
governed." 
PERSONAL LIBERTY. — Freedom of action. — Every citizen is on an equal footing as to 
privileges and opportunity. Any denial of such rights results from either the limited 
ability of the individual to take full advantage of opportunity, or because of prejudices 
in no way a part of the ruling law of our land.  
Born free citizens, or acquiring that right through naturalization, we have full 
freedom of action — without infringement upon the rights of others — to reside or 
travel at home or abroad under the protection and with all privileges accorded by our 
Government, regardless of race, color, religion, or social station.  
Full opportunity is here given to every citizen to work out his own ideals and ideas. 
To the native born this privilege is accepted as a matter of no great significance, for 
he is wholly unfamiliar with the laws, traditions, and customs that direct and restrict 
individual action of citizens in foreign countries. 
PAGE 34 
The American citizen frequently changes his occupation. His very liberty keeps 
him on the alert for an opportunity to better his financial or social status. The change 
is one of occupation, not of personality; his pride and self-respect are not involved. 
 RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. — No greater liberty was ever conferred on a people than that of 
freedom to worship according to the dictates of one's own conscience. The first 
amendment to the American Constitution declares that:  
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibit 
the free exercise thereof."  
All persons have the privilege to entertain any religious belief, practice any 
religious rite, teach any religious doctrine, which is not subversive of morality and 
does not interfere with the personal rights of others.  
However, this liberty cannot be "invoked as a protection against legislation for 
the punishment of acts inimical to the peace, good order, and morals of society," 
because professed doctrines of religious belief are not superior to the laws of the land. 
No person is permitted to become a law unto himself, nor may any person in the name 
of religion, or through a religious ceremony, violate the law. 
Religion and national defense. — There is no place for the doctrine of "noncooperation." 
Religious beliefs will not excuse any citizen from rendering service in the defense of 
the country, although Congress has power at its discretion to exempt him. 
 FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND PRESS. — The right to act, to think, to speak, to print, is the surest 
way to protect the liberties, and continue the full measure of independence which 
America so richly possesses. In these rights lies the means of creating a public opinion 
representative of the entire Nation.  
PAGE 35 
This liberty is indispensable to further social, economic, and political 
development. Clash of opinions creates interest and thought on all public questions. A 
realization of the force of public opinion expressed by the ballot, awakens a sense of 
responsibility that compels the best minds to careful study to any subject that vitally 
concerns our Nation. give Through the present means of communication, the people 
are daily informed in every matter of national or international import. 
Abuses. — This privilege does not permit the publication of libels or other matter 
injurious to public morals or private reputation. Like all liberties granted under the 
broad principles of the American Constitution, these rights are abused to the detriment 
of the best interests of the people. 
Restriction of abuses. — There is no law in any state or nation that prohibits freedom 
of speech or press, but there are laws against the abuse of this right. Restrictions may 
be necessary for the preservation of public order and the protection of the State. While 
Congress is forbidden by the American Constitution to abridge the freedom of speech 
or the press, the punishment of those who violate every principle of loyalty and 
patriotism modifies in no manner the constitutional provision. The law punishes 
because of the crime against the country and its citizens. 
The first amendment "cannot have been, and obviously was not, intended to give 
immunity for every possible use of language." — Justice Holmes. 
Blackstone's maxims, which help to interpret the present limitation on speech and 
press: 
(1) Between public and private rights, the public rights must prevail. 
(2) Liberty to all, but preference to none. 
PAGE 36 
(3) Those offenses should be most severely punished which are most difficult to guard 
against 
 ECONOMIC LIBERTY. — Property rights safeguarded. — Under no other government are 
property rights of the individual so provided with safeguards' for their full protection. 
Property is at the base of civilization. Without incentive of right to its private 
possession and full protection against confiscation no progress would be made in 
material betterment. 
Economic liberty, the power of initiative, and the protection of property rights have 
developed a philosophy of life peculiar to America — the "dignity of work." Every 
American is expected to be a worker. 
Based upon the constitutional assurance of the security of property, finance and labor 
have joined in the creation of industry, making America the richest nation in the world. 
Her wealth has been distributed to the enrichment of her entire population. 
Political liberty. — Equal participation. — The list of public- office holders in city, State, 
and Nation reveals the measure of political liberty granted in America. There are found 
representatives of practically every race in the world. They have been elected by the 
people as their able and honorable representatives. Every citizen enjoys the protection 
and benefits of our municipal, State, and National Governments.  
Any suggestion of racial or religious differences is frowned upon. It is the sincere 
wish of the majority that tolerance and understanding weld our people of all 
nationalities into a social, economic, and political unity for the purpose of developing a 
strong national character and a race of men and women whose ideals and attainments 
shall be an inspiration and help to the peoples of all the earth. The greatest degree of 
political liberty is secured by wise laws properly enforced. Anarchy destroys liberty 
because it is lawlessness and confusion, and utter disregard of all government. 
Safeguards to our liberties. — By clinging to the ideas and ideals which 
animated the framers of the Declaration of Independence, we can assure not only 
peace within, but national security and respect from other nations. When we fail to 
adequately comprehend the principles incident to our government, its fundamental 
ideals which have made our Government, the United States of America faces anarchy 
and destruction. 
Let our object be our country, our whole country, and nothing but our country, 
and by the blessing of God may that country itself become a vast and splendid 
monument, not of oppression and terror, but of wisdom, of peace, and of liberty, upon 
which the world may gaze with admiration forever. — Webster, 
THE PURPOSE OF GOVERNMENT 
The purpose of government. — A correct understanding of the purposes of 
government furnishes a remedy for erroneous and dangerous ideas threatening this 
Government of laws. — Until the adoption of a constitution, government was 
imposed by the will of the minority and enforced by absolute control of economic 
institutions and military forces. Under a constitution a "Government of laws and not of 
men" was formulated out of the experiences of the centuries in which feudalism, 
despotism, autocracy had given form to the ruling forces of government. 
Sources of the American Constitution. — The underlying principles of the 
Constitution were not formulated in a day. The three great American charters of liberty 
contained the fundamental principles of American government: "Bill for establishing 
religious freedom in Virginia," "Virginia Bill of Rights," and "Declaration of 
Independence." Before the Constitutional Convention met in Philadelphia, many plans 
and suggestions were drafted and presented to the convention. 
PAGE 37 
PAGE 38 
country. Government is instituted for the common benefit, maintaining order, and 
protecting life, liberty, and property. To secure liberty is the main business of 
governments and the reason for their institution. — Blackstone. 
THE PREAMBLE TO THE CONSTITUTION. — The Preamble to the Constitution is a most 
accurate and comprehensive statement of the purpose of government. It explicitly sets 
forth the fundamental purposes for which government is primarily organized. The 
brevity, simplicity, and directness of its original draft, after 150 years of experience, 
require no change.  
We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, 
establish Justice, insure Domestic Tranquility, provide for the Common Defense, 
promote the General Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our 
Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution of the United States of America. — 
Preamble to the Constitution. 
"We, the people." — The convention, which met in Philadelphia in 1787, adopted a 
Constitution based upon the proposition that a people can govern themselves. Under 
the Articles of Confederation, the State assumed control. A single State might exercise 
veto power over the will of all the others. In the government set up under the new 
Constitution the power and rights of the people are the source and final authority.  
It derives its "just powers from the consent of the governed." For the first time 
in human history "the people" assumed control and government became subject to 
their will. Nowhere is American independence and self-reliance better exemplified than 
in the words, 
 "We, the people." The people, the highest authority known to our system, from 
whom all our institutions spring and upon whom they depend, formed it. — President 
Monroe. 
PAGE 39 
"A more perfect Union." — In the original federation the States were but loosely 
joined. The Constitution was a demand for more effective control of the Union by the 
Government. In the efficacy and permanency of your Union a government for the whole 
is indispensable * * *. You have improved upon your first essay (Articles of 
Confederation) by the adoption of a constitution of government « » » for the 
efficacious management of your common concerns. * * * Indignantly frown upon the 
first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or 
to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts. — Washington 
— Farewell Address. 
"Justice." — Our government assures "justice" in that it is a government of laws, 
not of men. In the heat of passion or sectional interest, in clashes between groups or 
questions of policy, no minority or bloc may enforce its will. Should a majority seek to 
injure the rights of an individual citizen, the power of veto resting in the President, or 
the power of the Supreme Court as an unbiased tribunal, will insist that justice be done. 
A series of checks and balances, which prevent the selfish interests of either 
individuals or groups from exercising their will to the injustice of another, is provided 
by the Constitution. 
General welfare." — The National Government . Possessed of its own natural 
resources, in the development of which it is necessary for its own best interests to 
have the full cooperation of every, other State in exchange of raw materials, finished 
products, and farm produce. Its great land areas and mighty rivers are frequently the 
concern of several States or of the entire Nation. It is within the power of Congress to 
appropriate funds for constructing canals, river and harbor development, and control 
irrigation. projects where more than one State is interested, hard roads, and 
Postal Service; to regulate communications and transportation; and, through 
its various departments, perform such other services as will result in benefit to all 
citizens. This is not paternalism, but that protection of person and property which 
enables the citizen to obtain the greatest possible returns in the exercise of his own 
initiative. 
"Blessings of liberty." — To secure the "blessings" of liberty was the 
fundamental purpose of the makers of the Constitution and its subsequent adoption. 
They include all the rights and privileges that a citizen of this country enjoys — a voice 
in the Government; freedom to worship according to the dictates of the individual 
conscience; freedom of speech and of the press; the lack of restriction upon all 
inherent individual rights. The liberty of America is not that which permits the individual 
citizen to do as he pleases. He may so long as he does not interfere with the liberty of 
others. The liberty of the individual ends where the rights of others begin. 
emphasizes that —(1) Individual rights are sacred and it is necessary to establish a 
government in the protection of these rights. (2) All the powers of government are 
The "blessings" which the citizen enjoys under our form of government are 
secured through "liberty under law," the enforcement of which is their only safeguard. 
The purpose of our Government is to protect (not to provide) the property of its 
citizens; to guard his person (not to provide his subsistence) while he acquires the 
means of livelihood; to give every citizen equal opportunity in his chosen work and 
assure him of equal standing before the law. 
Our Government is the most nearly perfect of all in securing individual rights and 
insuring the blessings of liberty. In no other nation is equal opportunity and equal 
protection assured, with such equal division of reward for labor and services rendered.  
THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY OF GOVERNMENT. — The American philosophy of government 
PAGE 40 
PAGE 41 
derived from the people, who retain the supreme authority over all delegated powers 
of government. (3) Individual rights are not permitted to be exercised in the 
contravention of the rights of society. Individual liberty is always bounded by social 
obligations. (4) Government is exercised for the purpose of protecting the individual in 
his rights. (5) Governmental powers are delegated to the National, State, or local 
authority, and are limited in their exercise by provisions of the Constitution as 
interpreted and defined by the Supreme Court. (6) All rights not thus delegated are 
recognized as the inviolable right of the individual citizen and cannot be usurped by any 
governmental power. (7) The Government of the United States is not a democracy but 
a Republic. The National Republic of the United States of America. 
REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT. — The American experiment. — A few races qualified 
themselves for self-government. To establish that form of government was a long, hard 
struggle which culminated in the great American experiment. The United States set up 
a distinct and different form of government, the product of distinct racial stocks and 
centuries spent in learning the principles and art of self-government. In practice, our 
form of government is the most nearly perfect in securing individual rights and 
ensuring the blessings of liberty. It differs from previous forms in certain vital and 
fundamental principles which have come to be known as "American institutions." 
Among these is that of self-government by representation, which is "the golden mean 
between autocracy and democracy." 
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS. — The following comparative analysis shows the principal 
characteristics of the three forms of government: 
Autocracy: Authority is derived through heredity. People have no choice in the 
selection of their rulers and no voice in making of the laws. Could results in if no Moral 
law within the Autocracy:  arbitrariness, tyranny, and oppression, feudalistic. 
PAGE 42 
DEMOCRACY: A government of the masses. Authority derived through mass 
meeting or any other form of “direct" expression. Results, in mobocracy. Attitude 
toward property is communistic — negating property rights. Attitude toward law is 
that the will of the majority shall regulate, whether it be based upon deliberation or 
governed by passion, prejudice, and impulse, without restraint or regard to 
consequences. Results in demagogism, license, agitation, discontent, anarchy, 
Carnality, etc. 
REPUBLIC: 
Authority is derived through the election by the people of public officials best 
fitted to represent them. Attitude toward property is respect for laws and individual 
rights, and a sensible economic procedure. Attitude toward law is the administration 
of justice in accord with fixed principles and established evidence, with a strict regard 
to consequences. A greater number of citizens and extent of territory may be brought 
within its compass. Avoids the dangerous extreme of either tyranny or mobocracy. 
Results in statesmanship, liberty, reason, justice, contentment, and progress. Is the 
"standard form" of government throughout the world.  
A republic is a form of government under a constitution which provides the 
election of (1) an executive and (2) a legislative body, who working for together in a 
representative capacity, have all the power of appointment, all power of legislation, all 
power to raise revenue and appropriate expenditures, and are required to create (3) 
a judiciary to pass upon the justice and legality of their governmental acts and to 
recognize (4) certain inherent individual rights. 
PAGE 43 
 Take away any one or more of those four elements and you are drifting into 
autocracy. Add one or more to those four elements and you are drifting into democracy. 
— Atwood. 
Democracy is the "direct" rule of the people and has been repeatedly tried 
without success. 
Our Constitutional fathers, familiar with the strength and weakness of both 
autocracy and democracy, with fixed principles in mind, defined a representative 
republican form of government. They "made a very marked distinction between a 
republic and a democracy * * * and said repeatedly and emphatically that they had 
founded a republic." Madison, in the Federalist, emphasized the fact that this 
government was a republic and not a democracy, the Constitution makers having 
considered both an autocracy and a democracy as undesirable forms of government 
while "a republic * * * promises the cure for which we are seeking." 
In a democracy the people meet and exercise the government in person. In a 
republic they assemble and administer it by their respective agents. — Madison. 
The advantage which a republic has over a democracy consists in the substitution 
of representatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render them 
superior to local prejudices and to schemes of injustice. — Madison. 
The American form of government is the oldest republican form of government 
in the world and is exercising a pronounced influence in modifying the governments of 
other nations. Our Constitution has been copied in whole or in part throughout the 
earth.  
No direct action. — Under the representative form of government there is no 
place for "direct action." The inherent characteristic of a republic is government by 
representation. The people are permitted to do only two things; they may vote once 
every four years for the executive and once in two years for members of the legislative 
body. 
Methods of representative government. — Constitutional government may be set 
up under either a written or an unwritten Constitution. 
An unwritten constitution. — An unwritten constitution consists largely of 
customs, precedents, conditions, and understandings, and is constantly changing; any 
party in power may enact legislation materially affecting the methods of government 
and the political rights of citizens. 
A written constitution. — In the United States the rights of the people are fully 
protected and the functions of government strictly defined in a written document — 
the Constitution. It is called a “rigid Constitution" because the legislative power has no 
authority to change it. It is subject to amendment only by the authority and action of 
the people through their representatives in Congress. The Congress, whenever two
thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this 
Constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several 
states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which in either case, shall 
be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the 
legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three-fourths 
thereof, as one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress; 
provided* * * that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage 
in the Senate. — Constitution, Article V. 
As a wall of protection our written Constitutions i.e., American Constitution and 
National Government’s Divine Constitution & By-Laws,  stands between the people and 
PAGE 44 
those who, through lust for power, or the temporary passions of the moment, or for 
any other reason, would trespass upon the rights of person or property.  Consent of 
the governed. — The original desire of the colonists was "only to have a voice" in the 
affairs of the Government. Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just 
powers from the consent of the governed * * *.  
— Declaration of Independence. The situation so developed that the colonists 
totally dissolved "all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain," 
and established a new form of government based upon the "consent of the governed." 
"Consent" in the drafting and approval of the instrument of government and its 
subsequent amendment was a new feature. 
Subsequently, many of these features were incorporated in the first10 
amendments, adopted in 1791 as supplements to the Constitution, and are called the 
"American Bill of Rights." — When the Constitutional Convention was ending 
several members who opposed the adoption of the Constitution suggested several 
amendments, which, they declared, "would make the Constitution acceptable to them." 
While the Constitution already contained many provisions for the protection of the 
rights of the individual citizen, various States desired that it contain further written 
stipulations that would remove every possibility of doubt and prevent disputes by 
"leaving no matters to inference, implication, or construction." It was contended that 
the provision of the suggested Bill of Rights contained "various exceptions not granted 
* * *. 
Why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?" The 
tyranny of legislature is a most formidable dread at present and will be for many years. 
That of the Executive will come in its time, but it will be at a remote period. — Madison. 
PAGE 45 
PAGE 46 
"American Bill of Rights." The first 10 amendments embodied "guaranties and 
immunities ...." — Supreme Court (1897).  
 Enumeration of constitutional rights. — Individual rights formally guarded by 
original constitutional provisions: No ex-post facto laws. No bill of attainder. No 
suspension of privileges of habeas corpus. Trial by jury and at places where the crimes 
were committed. Definition of treason and limiting punishment. Guaranty of immunity 
and privileges of all States to the citizens of each State. No religious test before 
admission to public office. 
To which the Bill of Rights added: 
Right of peaceable assembly and petition to the Government for redress of 
grievances. Freedom of religion, speech, and press. Right of the people to keep and 
bear arms — militia. Quartering of soldiers only as provided by law. Protection against 
unreasonable searches. Right of accused to indictment by grand jury with certain 
exceptions. No compulsory testimony against self. No deprivation of rights without due 
process of law. No confiscation of private property for public use without just 
compensation. Right of a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury. Right to demand 
information concerning the nature and cause of accusation.  
To be confronted with witnesses against him. Compulsory process for obtaining 
witnesses in his favor. Have assistance of counsel for defense. Right of trial by jury in 
suits of common law where value and controversy shall exceed $20. Protection of 
verdict of said jury. No excessive bail required.  
No imposition of excessive fines. No infliction of cruel and unusual punishment. 
Rights retained by the people shall not be denied nor disparaged. Powers not delegated 
to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved 
to the States or to the people. 
PAGE 47 
 GOVERNMENT BY REPRESENTATION. — The framers of the Constitution were opposed to 
direct government. The remedy sought was to be found in representative government. 
Madison declared that the object to which their efforts wore to be directed was how 
to prevent a majority rule and to preserve the spirit and form of popular government. 
The representative form of government was their answer.  
The United States shall guarantee to every State in the Union a republican form 
of government. — Constitution, Article IV, section 4. 
 
NATIONAL CHARACTER. —  
National character is the sum of every citizen. The Nation has a right to expect 
each citizen to maintain high ideals, and he has a right to expect the same of his 
neighbor. The resulting measure of satisfaction should spur any right-thinking 
individual to such attainment. The actual worth of a citizen to himself, his community, 
his country, regardless of any other accomplishment, is based on the high quality and 
standard of his thinking. Obedience to higher impulses builds up self-respect without 
which no true success is possible. 
Community and home. — The United States has been developed by a succession 
of communities, independent of each other, yet closely related in their social, economic, 
and political interests. The character of the community is determined by the character 
of its homes and the character of its homes is determined by the character of the 
individual citizen. He is the only person upon whom responsibility for community and 
home can be placed.  
Importance of active citizenship. — Good government is the responsibility of the 
individual citizen in whom final authority is vested. It will be no higher in its ideals nor 
PAGE 48 
just in its administration than the sum of our national character. The first and 
paramount duty of every citizen is to have a firsthand knowledge of the Constitution of 
the United States. He should learn the accurate, comprehensive, and masterly 
statement of the six principles of government as contained in the Preamble, and the 
plan for setting up and maintaining our representative form of government. It is in this 
document that individual rights and fundamental duties are set forth. 
 Law and order. — The best government is that in which justice is most evenly 
administered. The better our government, the more prosperous and contented the 
people. Every time the citizen assists the administration of justice, he makes a material 
contribution to the welfare of all. Every citizen should observe and respect the law. It 
is no excuse that if a certain law interferes with his personal habits, desires, or beliefs 
he should disregard it. Absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority when 
legally expressed is the vital principle of republics. It is your personal responsibility 
not to contribute to the defeat of justice either by evading the law or consenting to its 
evasion by others. Statutory laws are presumed to be just and for the benefit of all 
law-abiding citizens. No greater responsibility rests upon the citizen than to demand 
just laws and their enforcement. There is nothing more degrading, more destructive in 
its effect upon personal honor and character, than evasion of law, bribery of officers, 
or contributing to the delinquency of others. 
Public opinion. — Within each community there is an invisible, government which 
we call "public opinion." Without this force our courts and police would be powerless 
in their effort to control. Only in proportion as public opinion backs the law can it or 
will it be enforced. To protect the land from the overflow of our great rivers we erect 
dikes along their banks. The moment a "sand boil" appears behind a dike a crew is 
rushed to the place, and repairs are made to prevent a break that might bring disaster 
to thousands. Public opinion, expressing the true character of home and community, is 
PAGE 49 
the dike that protects America from the overflow of crime, immorality, irreligion, and 
injustice, which, if allowed to break through, will do an irreparable damage to the free 
institutions of America. 
Public opinion reaches an uncommonly high level because every citizen is called 
upon to express his own judgment in community and national affairs, and to work for 
the betterment of his town, county, State, and country. It is your personal responsibility 
to mold and control public opinion. 
RESPONSIBILITY cannot be transferred. — "Responsibilities gravitate to the man 
who can shoulder them and power flows to the man who knows how." The recognition 
of the inequality of ability and the equality of moral obligation makes individual 
responsibility distasteful to the defective citizen. Efforts are being made to supplant 
the individual responsibility of American citizens with "State responsibility" which 
destroys self-respect, ambition, and national character. It demands "State control" 
which not only promises to relieve the citizen of his individual responsibility, but it also 
deprives the individual citizen of his personal liberties. It is the duty of every American 
citizen to prevent the destruction of our Republic and individualistic form of 
government by any such destructive political philosophy. -The closing words of the Declaration of Independence reveal the seriousness 
with which the signers fulfilled their personal responsibility: “...For the support of this 
Declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually 
pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor...” 
FREEDOM NOT A GIFT. — Freedom is not a gift. It has been bought and paid for in the 
sacrifices of peace and war. It is laid in long hours of toil, the swing of the ax in the 
forest, the campfire of the lonely pioneer, the sod house of the early settler, the 
community stockade and the frontier Army post. Freedom has traveled a long, hard 
PAGE 50 
road. None but the strong and courageous have possessed it and by no others can it 
be retained. 
PREPAREDNESS AN AGENCY FOR PEACE. — The desire for peace is the spirit of America, 
but that peace must be dynamic, not a peace characterized by weakness of purpose 
or lack of courage. 
MORAL QUALITIES ESSENTIAL TO SELF-PRESERVATION. — The American citizen 
must emphasize those qualities of character which mark him as truly worthy of the 
privileges of independence and liberty. His claim to self-respect is sound only as he 
upholds the self-respect of his fellow citizens. His honor is sacred only as he protects 
the honor of his country. He values liberty and independence only in so far as he is 
willing to pay the price for its protection. 
“...We mutually pledge our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor...” — Signers 
of the Declaration of Independence. 
The moral qualities essential to self-preservation are —implementing the 
attributes of Love, Truth, Peace, Freedom, and Justice; The will to win, where it does 
not compromise your morals. The courage to endure. The willingness to die for the 
principles of your vine and fig tree. 
CIVIC DEFINITIONS: 
Nation means A people, or aggregation of men, existing in the form of an 
organized jural society, inhabiting a distinct portion of the earth, speaking the same 
language, using the same customs, possessing historic continuity, and distinguished 
from other like groups by their racial origin and characteristics, and generally, but not 
necessarily, living under the same government and sovereignty. See Montoya v. U. S.,

Rep. 744. Besides the element of autonomy or self-government, that is, the 
independence of the community as a whole from the interference of any foreign power 
in its affairs or any subjection to such power, it is further necessary to the constitution 
of a nation that it should be an organized jural society, that is, both governing its own 
members by regular laws, and defining and protecting their rights, and respecting the 
rights and duties which attach to it as a constituent member of the family of nations.
